# 365DaysOfCodeJournal

In this repository I will document the progress, results and outputs of this challenge I'm making.
100 Days completed !!  
I will document a wide range of activities, including but not limited to reading, tutorials, lessons,
university assingments, side projects, work, problem solving, research and everything related to coding/programming I do.

---

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: pointer's declaration, access, storage, dereference, arithmetic, also dynamic memory allocation and  
passing pointers to functions, returning pointers from functions, references, L and R-values in C++.  
Gulp JS crash course including moving and copying files, concatenating files, minify (uglyfy) files, and optimize images.

**Thoughts**: I've been learnign C++ lately and it feels so powerful, yet, kinda simple to use, since I really learned how to code in C, it feels
quite familiar, however there are some importante differences I will encounter lately. Pointers look really low level, since it's kind of interacting
with hardware, it gives me the sensation of power and control of what I want to do, it's really interesting. Gulp is a handy tool, a nice understanding
of what I can do to enhance workflows, I don't it's a _MUST_ in the knowledge baggage, but sure it won't hurt to learn a little bit deeper.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: OOP in C++: classes, constructors, initialization list, delegation of constructors, copy constructors, class member manipulation, shallow vs deep copying, move constructors with l-value and r-value parameters, public vs private, methods, destructors, friends of class, static classes, 'this' pointer. LeetCoded in the Microsoft Top Questions, solving 4 problems in Arrays and Strings cathegory (since it's a paid feature of LeetCode, I cannot provide further details on the problem's number or description).

**Thoughts**: I learnt about OOP about 2.5 years ago, coded in Java, and I was somewhat familiar with OOP in C++ since I was familiar with C structs and
OOP overall, I think it's always good to reinforce the foundations of coding once in a while, and since I will be using Unreal Engine soon to do a guided
videogame, an OOP "crash course" comes in handy. After OOP there are 4 topics left, smart pointers, error handling, streams and STL; I'm really excited about the STL section, It will benefit me a lot for problem solving.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to GraphQL, querying, nested querying, babel setup for projects, ES6 import/export and a small API example of a query returning a simple string.

**Thoughts**: A little break from C++ as I don't want to overload me with a specific topic, since I've been done waaay more than an hour on the challenge, so the next topic I'm into (besides AI/ML wich I will start on Monday 6) is GraphQL, in my past job I worked with it by doing queries, mutations and subscriptions, but now I'm looking for knowledge in design and creation of GQL APis. I kinda have a previous experience _doing_ GQL, I did it with Absinthe for an Elixir backend, but it was kind of a mess and It didn't workout properly.

## Day 4, Jan 4th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Data types on GQL, custom types (class like), operation arguments, array manipulation, simple relational data and by arrays.

**Thoughts**: Imagine the data as a graph is much more simpler than thought at first glance, we can even think of it as a "relational database" that can be cyclical and can access a lot of information as long as it's related without thinking about all inner joins of tables, and where clauses on queries etc. I think GQL is truly the future of APIs, I don't think it will be the norm for this year, but I have a gut feeling that most small companies and even large companies will start to create and/or migrate their apis to GQL, since these API's can be accesed with a client like Altair (on browser) or Postman.

## Day 5, Jan 5th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. operations) in GQL, custom defined input types for mutations leading to a better and more undestandable code, babel configuration of plugins.

**Thoughts**: Been familiar with mutations in graphql only on the frontend, on the backend it looks way more interesting and I think this part is another example of the power of GQL and why it's the future. Tomorrow I will start to add Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to this challenge.

## Day 6, Jan 6th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Started a new journey in the world of research, I enrolled in a _R&D_ career path on my university, where I will work with profesors all around the world to perform research and develop new, innovative and open source projects, I'm starting to familiarize with the project, _grosso modo_ it consist of Business Process Simulations with automatization and enhancement of parameters in orden to obtain the most realistic simulation possible with the given data logs. I will be working with Python and Jupyter notebooks in the future of this project. Re-started my AI journey with Q-Learning, getting the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, the Bellman equation and Markov decision processes, I have 3 papers to read to go deeper and fully understand the concepts, I will read them tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: This research "course" looks very interesting and very promising, I will be working with at least 3 PhD professors and I finally will be involved on this career path that I've been dreaming on.

## Day 7, Jan 7th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Read 'Reinforcement Learning I: Introduction' from Richard Sutton ad Andrew Barto; onto AI, the policy vs plan of reinforcement learning, the 'living penalty', full Q-learning intuition and the temporal difference. Added 2 papers to my to read list.

**Thoughts**: I honestly was expecting a lot more from Hadelin de Ponteves and Kiril Eremenko, since I listen to thoir SuperDataScience podcast (which I love) and I have been enrolled in one of their courses previously and they were really good (in my opinion), but this one feels so shallow, don't get me wrong, it's explained in a way many people can understand without a super background on mathematics or computer science, but it lacks on awe-inspiring content. The paper was also really well written, not to technical not too casual with some examples that anyone can understand.

## Day 8, Jan 8th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on trial and error, simulations and mostly exploration of the tools Signavio, BIMP and Simod, in order to comprehend what the programs are doing and analizing the data outputs by the given inputs.

**Thoughts**: Business Process Modeling is a hot topic in Europe, mostly in research universities and being part of many PhD students, I'm currently working with one PhD professor and indirectly with other 3 located in different parts of the world, so this is going to be very enriched learning.

## Day 9, Jan 9th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked with my professor from research developing a mxml to xes parser in Java (repo will be available tomorrow) in order to start creating 'pipelines' from Signavio to Simod and verifying everything works correctly to start adding functionalities to Simod in a forked repository. Full description of Deep Q-Learning (Q-Learning + ANN) on the Udemy course, covering topics like learning, acting, experience replay and action selection policies (epsilon greedy, epsilon soft, softmax).

**Thoughts**: Didn't remember how powerfull is java, specially on older formats of data, we worked with .jar libraries that helped us a lot, but finding them was kinda tricky, since we had to "scrap" a little bit into OpenXES and other websites to get the right compatible library.

## Day 10, Jan 10th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked many hours trying to figure out how the notebook works and find why it does not work with other inputs rather than the provided. At the end, slight modifications where done and from now on, my forked repository will be the one I will be working on.

**Thoughts**: Reading other people's code (even Python) can be tricky if not documented properly, my goal is to document any progress I do and eventually, document the previous work done.

## Day 11, Jan 11th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Watched many hours of tutorials on Adobe XD to improve my prototyping/sketching and UI/UX notions on web.

**Thoughts**: It's a super nice to use tool, It's a shame it is not available for Ubuntu (my main OS), fortunately I have a Windows laptop so I can learn it and use it. It really feels like a drag and drop website builder, wish I had learnt this before.

## Day 12, Jan 12th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Operator overloading theory,overloading asingment operator (copy and move), overloading operators as member functions, overloading operators as global functions and overloading the stream insertion and extraction operators.

**Thoughts**: Wow, I think this is some next level C++, it's actually not a thing that one will normally use in a program, it has specific use cases and definetly comes in worthy in large scale projects. I find very interesting to overload "native" functionalities from a language to do whatever you want to do (as long as it keeps it's arity).

## Day 13, Jan 13th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Inheritance concept, terminology and notation, composition, deriving classes, protected members and class access, constructors and destructors (super constructors).

**Thoughts**: This looks like some serious OOP advantage over common procedural programming. I'm currently thinking of learning some Qt for C++ UI and build something great that uses everything I've learnt so far, but, I want to finish this course first and then learn the basics of Qt while building something nice.

## Day 14, Jan 14th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Keeping up with inheritance...passing arguments to base class constructos, copy/move constructos and operator '=' with derived classes, redefinig bases class methods (kinda like 'overloading', where the same name does other thing), multiple inheritance (just scratched the surface of the concept, no work done on this secction).

**Thoughts**: Multiple inheritance looks amazing, I'm eager to learn more aboout it, I'm honestly dissapointed the course does not cover it well, but at least it developed curiosity in me to learn more about that topic, seems more tedious (higher levels of abstraction, maybe things will be way too general to make it work) than complex to implement it.

## Day 15, Jan 15th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Back to AI, onto Deep Q-Learning, starting the process of the environment design, using kivy for the UI, defining initial states on the goal from the starting point. The environment consist of a car trying to reach a corner startring from the opposite corner, the 'lane' consists of a non-straigth path sorrounded by sand, where it 'slows' the car and gives penalty to the AI. The car has angle and rotation properties to properly turn to reach the goal, it has 3 sensors, that detects objects in the front, the left and the right, as well as 3 signals that are triggered by them. It also has many functions that update the movility given the last state and the environment, choosing the best option given by the AI. I penalyzes hitting on walls (edge of map) and it's countered by the sensors and updating the direction of the car (since it can only go forward). The penalty of hitting walls and drive away from the wall are the heaviest, while doing some progress it's a tenth of positive reward equivalent to the worst penalty. The main libraries for the AI is (obviously) numpy and pytorch. The Network class inherits from the pytorch Neural Network implementation, the input layer will be determined by the input_size parameter, as well ad the output neurons determined by the nb_action parameter, the full connections is the pytorch NN are fully connected by the Linear constructor giving the output of a Neural Network input(5) -> 30 hidden -> 30 hidden -> output(3). The forward function (for forward propagation) works on the state given by the environment, by using a rectifier function (RELU) to activate the neurons on the first hidden layer and getting the q values from the second hidden layer with the previous activations. Last but not least, the experience replay implemented as a class, constructed by the last 100 transitions memory space and the memory (list of events).

**Thoughts**: A 'environmentless' model will make the car act like a mad insect, just roaming around without directions (except from avoid the borders), it is reduced to a mere random movement. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch makes AI so much easier to implement, just import it, create it and use it.

## Day 16, Jan 16th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Implementation the 'queue-like' functionality on the ReplayMemory, alongside with the random memory access to get a batch-sized sample to map them into pytorch variables. For the creation of the model class (Deep Q-Learning) some initializations are required from the previous classes, and a gamma variable that is used to discount the reward as the time passes (the more actions the model does the lower the reward will be) and the creation of the Adam optimized binded to the model (Pytorch NN) with a learning rate of 0.001 and a memory (ReplayMemory) with a capacity of a hundred thousand. Using softmax and multinomial functions we are able to not always choose the best action, and do some exploration, the Temperature variable is set to 7 to ensure it acts more 'car-like' than 'insect-like', of course with the highest probability of choosing the best option. The learn is where all of the Q-Learning math happens, starting with outputs calculation given the batch state, predicting the next outputs with the highest q value, calculating our target with the previuosly defined gamma value, using the smooth_l1_loss to calculate our temporal difference, reset our optimized, perform a backpropagation and the using the optimizer to update the weights of the Neural Network.

**Thoughts**: Felt like a 0-60 in 3.6 seconds, really interesting how pytorch interacts with it's own variables and functions, I think is handcrafted with love and passion and thus making an output of a _great_ library, I'm really happy with the progress and what I am learning, with this code, feels like all the theory behind is really being applied in here.

## Day 17, Jan 17th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Made a MXML parser to CSV in order to make qualitative analysis on datasets related to our investigation. Using Pandas to manipulate the CSV and get usefult information.

**Thoughts**: We are going a bit slow on the investigation process, nonetheless we are very motivated to improve and get good results as an extent of that. I'm very excited of what I'm learning, the more days passes I feel more and more comfortable of what I'm doing and its solely because I understanding it further and further.

## Day 18, Jan 18th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Update function calculated using the last reward and the new signal to process as parameteres, the first thing to do is setting the new action to perform and add it to the memory with the push function. Then the action is selected given the new stage and if our memory storage has 100 or more memories, we trigger the learn function on the batches returned, then the last action is updated with the currect action, as well as the state, and the reward; the reward window is extended with the last reward, if the length exceeds 1000, the oldest result is deleted and finally returns the action so the program can perform it and repeat the process again. The score is calculated by calculating the mean of the reward window. To save the progress of the AI a save and load functions are implemented using PyTorch save dictionary. Read the theory of dynamic programming of Richard Bellman but did not understandit at 100%, there was a few math notation and concepts I'm totally unrelated to and had a though time actually, maybe later in the year, with more knowledge, I can better understand it.

**Thoughts**: Oh yes, a fully functional AI model with graphic representation, very happy for it! nevertheless I did not make it with my own hands, I'm planning to expand it and make it "smarter" in with way more sensors and variables, perhaps even speed, acceleration and many other stuff. I love Formula 1, so making an AI capable of achieve the best track path on the 22 circuits of this year's season will be a dream come true.

## Day 19, Jan 19th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Back to one of my favourite things, UX/UI. A basic canvas for mocking on mobile and how to use my smartphone to actually test it and see how it responds. Some more Adobe XD features.

**Thoughts**: Not really much today, been a little bit tired and unmotivated, dunno why actually.

## Day 20, Jan 20th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Back to the research, I was working hard on undestand concepts and finally came with a new updated parser that solved many problems we did not realize were happening, from MXML to XES.

**Thoughts**: A step up in the research, since we are trying to find an algorith to get the most accurate calendars of work.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [MXMLtoXES](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/MXMLtoXES "Updated")

## Day 21, Jan 21st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More from UX/UI, now with colors and text/fonts, for better presentation, good contrasts, even gradients, not much theory of colors or something like that, was pretty much an Adobe XD tutorial on colors, kinda dissapointed, the best part was the realistic buttons. New courses from my semester! I'll learn advanced databases, intelligent systems, compilers and computer vision, as well as keep making progress on research.

**Thoughts**: Need to go back to GraphQL and C++, finish them up as well as this and focus on AI and ML. Very happy and excited about the new semester, looks awesome, and I will commit to it a 100%, will be my best semester.

## Day 22, Jan 22nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Wanted a break from everything, so I searched in my Learnathon YouTube playlist something interesting and fount a video of Pug, wich is a HTML preprocessor in Node.js that basically turns HTML into a programming language with loops, conditionals, cases, mixins, etc.

**Thoughts**: Very interesting, highly recommend it to watch it at least for curiosity, just to know there is something out there called Pug that makes HTML more enjoyable.

## Day 23, Jan 23rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Heavy on research, made an Jupyter Notebook to make data exploration and read a _very_ interesting chapter of a really nice book written by Marlon Dumas, et. al., wich is a professor I will be working on indirectly, probably will meet him soon. The notebook are some basics of Pandas, I'm planning to get way better at pandas to make it a toolkit that I can handle, not only for this project, but for ML in general.

**Thoughts**: The book is written amazingly, fully understand it every single concept, maybe because I'm way more familiar with the topic and had previous knowledge of it, but I think anyone can understant it, highly recommend it if interested on the topic.

## Day 24, Jan 24th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Dynamic polymorphism, Base class pointers, virtual functions and destructors, override specifier, Base class references and Abstract classes as Interfaces.

**Thoughts**: The big concept of static vs dynamic I had in C++ was memory allocation for storage, never imagined that could be applied to so many things, ranging from constructors and destructors and virtual functions. I'm awed of the versatillity and power C++ provides, what most people say is that is super hard typed, memory picky, strict, hard to handle, obsolete and way less useful than it used to be (well, this could be true tho), but I think is that maybe they are missing a lot, I'm getting **_way_** behind my goal in LeetCode, but I will definetly solve as much problems as humanly possible with all my other stuff only in C++.

## Day 25, Jan 25th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Back to work, read a lot of the new React code on my job and did a little bit of changes, merele aesthetic, wich will be all of my work for this week, make the page look beautiful.

**Thoughts**: Need to step up my organizing game to make my dreams come true, almost a month gone and I feel my progress is 0, maybe because the first 2 weeks I was so emotionally bad and my lack of progress just made it worse, but I'm so much better now.

## Day 26, Jan 26th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Full on research today, managed to complete my task of data wrangling on the log.csv file generated by BIMP upon a .bpmn file created in Signavio. managed to use Pandas to create graphics and easily visualize the data so assuptions can be made.

**Thoughts**: Feeling making some progress!! super excited to move forward and go deeper in the analysis, I'm really really happy.

## Day 27, Jan 27th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Adobe XD functionalities like drawing custom icons (ideal for apps), stokes and lines, pen tool. Tips on how to work with Adobe Illustrator and InDesign alongside XD.

**Thoughts**: Feels werid-ish, not quite that happy with today's work, since I don't have Illustrator nor InDesign and as a Software Engineer my main task is to plan, code and execute, my graphic design habilities are far beneath the siol, so this came weird for me, I know some UI needs to bee done with more than CSS and Google Images, but this is really not for me.

## Day 28, Jan 28th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: A lot of discussion with my professor on where we should take the research, we are taking the right path and going on with a nice pace, our aim is to publish a paper for the BPM 2020 in Sevilla, Spain, with me as a coauthor for the paper. And with me as the lead and only author for a demo paper on my work to attend and do a speech at the same conference. Another options we are aiming are ICPM in Italy, CIC anc MICAI in Mexico. Updated the previous notebook to include hours in the schedule tracker.

**Thoughts**: Can't be more excited for my progress, I will put a 200% more effort to make thinks right.

## Day 29, Jan 29th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More progress on my applied research, on methods of calculating effective working hours when a log is given. More details will be displayed on the paper I will be co-author, for now, I'll just explain in a nutshell the progress.

**Thoughts**: We are about 1 and a half month to the deadline of the paper submission, we are very excited for our progress.

## Day 30, Jan 30th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More progress on my applied research, using a combined data of the event types of starting and completing tasks, an aproximate schedule is set for the minimum hour in the log and the maximum hour in the log, and their respective day, no assumptions are made that the resources work con continued days and at the same hours, but most of the software for simulation, including Simod (what we will upgrade) has this limitations of starting and ending day and starting and ending hour, there cannot be flexible schedules like Monday 8-10, Wednesday 8-12 and Friday 9-13; we understand the mayority of the industry runs fixed schedules, specially the ones that have logs, so for now, we will focus on fixed schedules but we leave the door open for flexible schedules. Just to relax myself did some CodeWars Katas on C++.

**Thoughts**: The progress that we had was... not what actually was needed, the actual logs does not contais a json object we were trying to insert on the XES file, so another approach needs to be done. Some CodeWars progress made (8 kyo to 7 kyo on C++) but I need to start doing LeetCode daily !! I need to better organize my time.

## Day 31, Jan 31st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: I discussed with my professor and we decided we need to upgrade our simulation tools, we kindly asked Abel (BIMP creator) to make some updates on his software, while he decides to update it or not, we are contemplating to use an open source one and have another researcher to upgrade it to our needs. Some extensions on Simod forked repository, for calendar creations, not only default and 24/7, work still in progress.

**Thoughts**: Going strong, one and a half month to go. At this pace we will make it to BPM 2020. I'm really happy.

## Day 32, Feb 1st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Deep Convolutional Q-Learning tutorial to make an AI play Doom, it's very interesting how 'easy' is to make an AI to 'see' and learn from it, since I will be taking a Computer Vision course at the university this semester, I'm planning to make something with AI for the final project. Startes the A3C intuition, the best _yet_ AI algorithm provided by Google.

**Thoughts**: AI is such a fantastic topic, my research is focused on Data Mining and Data Visualization (moreless), so I'm planning to maybe go big, further and beyond and trying to integrate some algorithms to improve the dathered data.

## Day 33, Feb 2nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Busy day, but I managed to learn/code for +1hr, sticking to my goals, back to GraphQL, onto mutations and proper folder structure.

**Thoughts**: Without messing with the database, GQL looks pretty easy (at least for now, I know subscriptions aka sockets are one tricky boi to implement), I'm really happy that I made progress even with a day full of chores and responsabilities.

## Day 34, Feb 3rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Consistency is key, that's why I managed to organize myself and finish the GraphQL basics, finishing the mutations with the updates and the subscriptions (sockets) that turned out to be quite easier to implement in the backend than in the frontend (previous experience).

**Thoughts**: Really happy about the progress, I'll continue on the weekend, since I need urgently to work on React on the Logic1 part and my research. Been way more tired lately, I'm starting to get worried.

## Day 35, Feb 4th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Simod notebook, specifically on the calendar creation, where only default values were available (24/7 & 9to5MonToFri). A lot of trial and error since it was not documented and the names are not quite as descriptive, specially the widget part.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a lot, but, was worth it, I'm starting to feel this project is mine (of course, in a non possesive way, I know it is not my work, but I really like being a part of).

## Day 36, Feb 5th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Apparently what I did was wrong, well, if not wrong, was unnecesary for the moment, I misunderstood a bit my professor, but, the project is not broken, just "wasted" a weekend. Worked with Scylla, a simulator (replacing BIMP in our workflow) to check the calendars, comparing the default (9 to 5, Monday to Friday) with a custom variation, turns out, the notebook (BPM Calendar) works as spected, so It will be integrated to the Simod notebook as a function, the thing is.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a lot, but, was worth it, I'm starting to feel this project is mine (of course, in a non possesive way, I know it is not my work, but I really like being a part of).

## Day 37, Feb 6th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Great progress made in the research, my output was as espected. The purpose of the BPM Calendar notebook is finally reached, retrieving a Calendar, it's next iteration will be getting the amount of resources. Started the XML creator, given the output of the previous notebook, it will create an XML configuration file for Scylla, and repeat the simulation in a pipeline, were we will determine the actual calendar of the resources.

**Thoughts**: Felt great it worked, needs refactoring, cleaning and documentation, but I'm really happy nevertheless.

## Day 38, Feb 7th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished my winter intensive courses in college, I'm feeling **really** tired, dunno why, but somehow managed to do 1+ hr on this challenge on upgrading the GraphQL environment with Prisma, a DB mounted on Heroku and using Docker.

**Thoughts**: It is great how many technologies are integrated in a such a simple project.

## Day 39, Feb 8th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished the calendar functionality on the BPM Calendar notebook, a full month of work in applied research, down to few lines of code. Upgraded de XML Creator but I can't get it to work properly.

**Thoughts**: Many many hours of work reduced to a single small notebook, feeling proud of me and my professor.

## Day 40, Feb 9th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Struggled a lot trying to make my work done on Logic1 responsive, I don't understand why some pages are fully responsive and others simply look awful, I need help from my colleague [JC](https://github.com/JCVelazco "GH Profile").

**Thoughts**: Feels bad to not improve my previous work, honestly.

**Link to Work / References** :

- No repo available (private)

## Day 41, Feb 10th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished XML Creator for Scylla configuration, my professor is very satisfied with my work, and I'm very proud of it, I have put onto it many many hours and the reward is actually tangible. Next step will be to make it a pipeline and decide the direction of the research paper based on the 'recently' published (similar topic) from belgium researchers. Finished some little topics on Prisma on my journy on GraphQL, next step will be Authentication. New semester beggins, with Compilers and Intelligent Systems looking very promising.

**Thoughts**: Had some anxiety lapses on December and January due to the fact I reached the final round on Microsft for intern and did not get an offer, I knew since then that I needed to practice and study more, nevertheless, I feel less and less motivated everyday to do Interview Problems, even tho landing a job on Microsoft is what I want the most right now. On a happier topic, I'm feeling very proud of myself for the reasearch progress.

## Day 42, Feb 11th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More new classes, Computer Vision: learnt some theory behind what it does and the building blocks of CV, on Advanced Databases, by my own, watched a long video about SQL queries, to refresh my memory.

**Thoughts**: More promising courses, I have high hopes for this semester, I will deliver my best at every class.

## Day 43, Feb 12th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: New analysis on the BPM Calendar notebook, on a new .csv file from a real source (not simulated), however, the output was not as spected, the amount of resources was way too high and the data was so messy, we need to do first a role discovery based on the Simod notebook to further clean the data. Added to the XML Creator a file writing functionality.

**Thoughts**: No BPM Sevilla, Spain, sinche Marlon will be part of the chair, we cannot send our paper ther, however, we will send it to a magazine, wich (as stated by my professor) will be much better for him and for me, so no more deadline on March 26th. I will still output the most out of me.

## Day 44, Feb 13th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More compilers theory, of how the general pipeline works, some topics on lexical analysis and semantic analysis. A review of Chomsky hierarchy and formal languages. More ML fundamentals, on the features classification (quantitative and qualitative), and some golden rules like: "Do not modify your data to make it fit for an algorithm and learn to work with incomplete data". How supervised algorithms are validated with techniques like k-fold cross-validation and random cross-validation.

**Thoughts**: I know I've been in this semester for a week, but it looks the best so far, I'm really really happy.

## Day 45, Feb 14th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More progress on discovering how to improve Simod, now we know the mid-output part of the process, it will be mixed with my BPM Calendar notebook and the feature I added to Simod to further create the calendars by Role (not resource) and go further with our research.

**Thoughts**: I spent many hours into it, because the code that simod.py uses is spread across many many files and it's not very well documented, sadly.

## Day 46, Feb 15th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basics of Matplotlib file displaying, as well as OpenCV image read concepts, and some drawing functions.

**Thoughts**: I'm super excited about my CV class, so I decided to take a little step forward to anticipate some of the usage of OpenCV with Python, since my professor will be using MATLAB.

## Day 47, Feb 16th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Since we are competing with another work, we decided to make a deep insight on our competence, so I read the article published by Elsevier on ScienceDirect. Apparently, what we are trying to do is moreless already done by them, but not exactly, and it's performed in R, and it's virtually no documented at all, not even a Readme, so it was really though figuring out what the code was doing (specially because I'm not quite familiar with R, just a few ML examples on it).

**Thoughts**: The expectations are high, and our competence is fierce, the paper was published last year but not that long ago, the code hasn't been updated since "the last" commit that it is actually named 'initial commit', so probably it will be abandoned, this gives us a window to improve our research and perform better with automatation and a GUI.

## Day 48, Feb 17th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Upgraded the XML writter in order to parse Simod's output on calendars into XML for Scylla, not that hard of a task but rather a little bit of time consuming, fun nonetheless.

**Thoughts**: I know this work will be 'useless' as soon as my colleague [Antonio Sánchez](https://github.com/ansacaa "GH Profile") finishes the new, upgraded and better version of scylla, but in python (not an executable jar file), but this will help me to improve my skills and code better and faster once the new versions of the simulator and splitminer are released.

## Day 49, Feb 18th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Long chapter reading on database transactions theory, it was a lot of content, I learn't a lot of things like issues that can occurr on concurrent access on databases, how to handle them and the event log completness, recoverability, serializability and what information should include.

**Thoughts**: Such an interesting topic, and I think it should be included in basic DB courses, because normally, real world databases will have concurrency.

## Day 50, Feb 19th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time doing work on the research, by mkaing the notebook better on how Simod works and adding a threshold support value to the schedules to 'mark' them correct. Tried to integrate Scylla to Simod, but the reference of Simo 1.0.0 is even less documented, so many many things were black boxes and configurations varied a lot between versions.

**Thoughts**: Uhh, kinda stuck right now, I actually don't know what to do to fix this, I'll ask my professor.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 51, Feb 20th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Exercises on regular languages and regular expressions, a little bit of a review from 2 semesters ago. Talked with my professor on what to do now that I reached a wall, so we decided to change the scylla jar we are using to a GUI-less one, since I have the configuration xml writer there should be no problem to execute it, I just need to get the bpmn file from splitminer on Production.xes and figure out the simulation file.

**Thoughts**: Many things to do and don't know where to start, but I better start it now if I want to finishit for Monday.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 52, Feb 21st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More computer vision theory and a little bit of practice on convolution operations, the downside of my course is that the professor uses Matlab, a non production/industry environment, so I use OpenCV and I need to constantly look for code equivalences.

**Thoughts**: Very lazy day actually, but managed to learn some things, repository will be available after deadline for homework.

**Link to Work / References** :

## Day 53, Feb 22nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Started (and semi-finished) my Intelligent Systems homework, where I need to analyze text and add features using [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/) and [Parallel Dots](https://www.paralleldots.com/) APIs. It was really fun and actually easy to do, just get the key, read the csv and perform the cols iterativeley. The big downsides were the amount of calls and the frequency of calls, Parallel Dots only allows 1000 calls a day within 1 sec each for the free tier, and MeaningCloud 20000 monthly with .5 seconds interval, and for sentiment analysis it uses 2 calls to get the response, so I spent a lot of it, If more work is needed, I may be use another account since I can't afford to pay 80-100 dollars for a homework.

**Thoughts**: Super fun to perform, I enjoyed a lot, once the deadline is met, the repository will be available (without the dataset).

## Day 54, Feb 23rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'responsiveness' on the Logic1CS webpage I was working on, apparently, jobs done, We are waiting for feedback in order to change, add or even develop new projects with them. Upgraded the Simod calendar recovery and resource pool, the XML creator was redesigned into a python script in order to call it from the notebook, some code cleaning was performed.

**Thoughts**: I think we are slowing down in a very bad way, we were having a great pace but suddenly, the 3 researcher students (including me) had a lot of trouble, More effort needs to be done.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 55, Feb 24th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More recap on finite automata for my compilers course, feels nice to remember things from 1+ year ago. More work done with Simod, with a better .jar file including the dependencies and how to execute it, it will be used alongside splitminer (yet the java version), the only missing thing is the xml simulation file for scylla, since the configuration is done and the bpmn file will be obtained with splitminer, Maybe I will use the Jupyter Notebook widgets to get some values, I don't want them to be hardcoded. Plus, more lectures on OpenCV and image processing techniques such as image blurring, smoothing and morfological operations and some theory behind the kernels (kinda like filters).

**Thoughts**: Back on track on research and computer vision, feeling with moreless large amounts of energy.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 56, Feb 25th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Worked with database desgin, on Entity Relation diagram and design of the system of a wholesale store based on memberships and divided in departments, as part of my advanced databases course to implement transactions. No repo will be available (PHP, PDO, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap project) until the delivery date is met (to avoid plagiarism).

**Thoughts**: This looks fun, It was a long time since I designed a system from scratch.

## Day 57, Feb 26th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Started my homework on computer vision, on image reading, and image and kernel validation, I don't quite fully undestand what the professor is asking so I need to talk to him to finish the homework.

**Thoughts**: Python + CV = Love. Homework is private, repo will be available as soon as the deadline is met.

**Link to Work / References** :

- No Repo Available

## Day 58, Feb 27th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Done my compilers homework, getting regular expressions and their finite automata, the trickiest part was the regex of a languages that do not includes abba as a subword.

**Thoughts**: Spent few minutes on 5 exercises and a lot more on the one mentioned above, felt weird. Since it's a handmade (no code) I don't think I will upload it to GH even after deadline.

**Link to Work / References** :

## Day 59, Feb 28th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Computer Vision homework, with basically was a hand-made convolution function given a image and a (gaussian) kernel, was not hard, and there are only 5 homeworks in the semester so I hope it gets thougher than this.

**Thoughts**: That was easy, fun nevertheless, repo will be available once deadline is met.

## Day 60, Feb 29th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Troubleshooting with [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) to convert csv file to arff (weka format), as part of my intelligent systems homework, but not much information is on the internet, some questions are as old as 2012 and didn't help me a lot, I managed to fix some issues, but others, apparently are problems with the content of the data, anyway, I spent many hours on it and didn't get any results.

**Thoughts**: Needless to say, I'm not satisfied, tomorrow will be full research and I'll wait for help from my professor to solve the weka problems.

## Day 61, Mar 1st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Getting the bpmn file out of splitkmines and writing the sim file in xml to provide to scylla, a litte inconveninence was encountered because the part of the process I extracted the xml did not contain their resource and the probability gateways did not have any data, so I have to imporove the file and make it automatic, will be job for tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Finally some advances in research, I know I've said it maybe a lot, but I need to elevate the pace, I don't know whats is happening to me, I cannot focus full time on my things.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 62, Mar 2nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: My professor is satisfied with my work, automation needs to be done, so I'll work on it. Finally! some code in compiles using flex, it was a hello world like exercise but code is code. On intelligent systems, the theory behing SVM it's awesome, I may use it for the final proyect, using word2vec + SVM, since the final goal is a highscore on kaggle, not the "perfect" model.

**Thoughts**: The ReGex conversor to Deterministic Finite Automata from flex to a c file it's just mind blowing, honestly, when I get to know that such things exists, I convice myself that there are a lot of gifted persons in the world contributing to it.

## Day 63, Mar 3rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More theory on Computer Vision, started a Udacity Free Program and in class, I made a challenge with my friend JC to finish the course in 11 weeks, let's see how much we learn together, since we are team in the CV course con college.

**Thoughts**: Still not very productive, getting distracted a lot, I'm desperate!.

## Day 64, Mar 4th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Practiced some SQL Queries by creating the database for the first homework in the university server, with some redesigning to improve performance and make it easier to understand and implement. Tried to progress on the research but the code is so badly documented that sometimes I don't know where to look when I'm trying to find something I need, however, once I got the things I need, I can further work on my part.

**Thoughts**: Feeling ok, getting contacted a lot from LinkedIn, unfortunately, full-time offers outside my posibilities to finish my carreer or it ended up in me not fullfilling requirements (specially 5+ years of experience or so).

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 65, Mar 5th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Overview of context free grammar and regular grammar in my Compilers class, started my essay in research-based learning for my Database course, learn a lot in my intelligent systems class, on pattern based algorithms, with the great advantage of being human-readable, some theory behind decision trees and association rules.

**Thoughts**: Lots of homework to do, If I haven't, now is time, yes, to or-ga-ni-ze my time properly.

## Day 66, Mar 6th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Some progress on research, tuns out I was doing it not right, I was analyzing data one step ahead than I should, no problem, now I know and my professor is still confident about me and the progress we all are making. Decided that the computer vision project will be sign language recognition, for now, we have letters and numbers both for men and women, but we need full words if we want to make it better.

**Thoughts**: Kinda dissapointed with the CV class, it's really boring, feels like a copy-the-code-understand-it-later-(maybe?).

## Day 67, Mar 7th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished my second homework of Intelligent Systems, consisting in convert a csv file to arff (for Weka) and obtaining insights about the data, I was really fun to watch many many plots and trying to give them the proper interpretation, understand how the data is separated between spam and non spam. Finished my essay on research-based learning.

**Thoughts**: Weka looks really powerfull, yet, feels very limited on what you can do, no doubt is super powerfull and fast, but there is something that doesn't convince me a lot.

## Day 68, Mar 8th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Super improved my XML writer for the simulation, however, the data it takes it's not "real" and the structure is very convenient for me, but I made it based on my previous interaction with data delivered by Simod, very close to the goal. I'll be back to my past job at Inment Dev becaouse I really need a stronger income for my girlfriend's masters degree, I'll rejoin on Wednesday.

**Thoughts**: I gotta be honest, I'm not super happy to add more stress to my life iwth more workloads but there is no better satisfaction than to see my love succeeding in life and improving herself.

## Day 69, Mar 9th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Yes, finally, the theory on Imbalances class for Machine Learning, the last homework was kind of a nightmare because it was so unbalances that making out conclussions was very hard, but now we are authorized to do undersampling to make it even. Started my database homework on implementing transactions on PDO.

**Thoughts**: .

## Day 70, Mar 10th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 8 hours doing the homework of PDO, learnt a lot of what NOT to do on php and PDO because at the end it failed, I failed my team and failed to myself.

**Thoughts**: One of the worst days I've ever had, I'm going to redo the whole project and I'll do it the right way this time, with a lot of transactions, triggers, events, etc., to show myself I can with proper preparation and to my professor before the exam (next Tuesday) to improve my grading, so, be on the lookout for that repository.

## Day 71, Mar 11th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Yes back to work, doing Angular (yay!), implementing sketches on financial reports that will make calls from a GraphQL API, very excited to keep working and improving my skills, and also keep supporting my girlfriend. New meeting, new project for CV, no more hand sign recognition, instead it will be a handwrite to speech/text.

**Thoughts**: Yeah, not that excited about the CV project,it was actually based on a hackathon winning project (but with very basic reading, like printing reading) and it's ok for a single person, maybe 2, not for 5.

## Day 72, Mar 12th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Pushdown automaton theory, feels amazing to remember such things, we will begin to write the final project (interpreter) very very soon). Bagging and Boosting on Machine Learning, learnt the advantages and disadvantages of both tecniques, personally, I thing ML/AI is the most interesting topic that can be related to math and pure computer science right now. FInished the third homework, making knn algorithms with k=3 and k=5 to train in weka and the test it and upload it to Kaggle(private contest).

**Thoughts**: The highest score was .58xxxx, and I personally felt really bad, I was virtually on last place, but then I discovered that all of the other participants used all the features we have mined, not only emotions, that made me feel better because I was the only one that followed the instructions haha.

## Day 73, Mar 13th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Done the 4th homework of intelligent systems, using 4 pattern-based classifiers, I used J48 (Decision Tree), Random Forest, FURIA and REPTRee and the highest perform was .63xxxx by FURIA. Did some other views in my job, about financial utilities for the hospital.

**Thoughts**: Weka is fun to use, but I want to write some code, I don't know, mixed feelings on it. I love my job, home office + angular, I can't ask for more right now.

## Day 74, Mar 14th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Done some lectures in Udacity about Computer Vision, very interesting by the way, a little bit more of GraphQL (because I need to finish it ASAP, I really like the topic and want to finish it).

**Thoughts**: My rest day, organized my next week and recovered my energy, but of course, keeping the challenge up by doing at least one hour, feeling proud, I'm almost 80% of the challenge until upgrading it to 365.

## Day 75, Mar 15th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Added 5 more features to my dataset for Intelligent Systems, using the abhorrend parallel dots API, adding the intent of the text (spoiler, I'm very dissapointed with the results), in order to do homework 5 and 6 tomorrow. Done a full summary for the Intelligent System's exam, although it will be next week.

**Thoughts**: Ah yes, Coronavirus, I'm quarantined and the best thing to do is to feed my brain, I'll have a very busy week doing a lot of homework, working in my research, working in my job and yes, LeetCoding (I will, I promise, you'll see).

## Day 76, Mar 16th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish my Intelligent Systems' homework, unfortunatly, although I managed to create cost matrix for CostSensitiveClassifier algorithm with FURIA, I couldn't do and undersampling with SpreadSubSample nor an oversampling with SMOTE, because somehow the button to apply those filters specifically was disabled. Finished 3/4 of my homework/exam for compilers, on designing Context Free Grammars and evaluate a Grammar to produce words, the missing part is a flex file that recognizes Java-like numbers, symbols and reserved words, that will be the fun part. Keeping the mood of Databases, did problems 1378, 1350 & 1068 of LeetCode.

**Thoughts**: Very dissapointed with my day, I was expecting to be way waaaaay more productive but Weka stopped me for about 3 hours with no solution, anyway, I still have some days to be very productive. I'm a bit worried, about the research, today I didn't have any motivation to do it, not at all, I don't know why, hopefully I will feel inspired tomorrow. LeetCoded, as promised, tomorrow will be the first thing to do instead before bed (when my energy is at lowest).

**Today's Progress**: Read some extracts of articles related to graph databases in order to do the second phase of research-based learning, I choose that topic because I find it really interesting and I think it will be the standard in the future, like GraphQL will be a must learn in univerisites.
Did problems 1342, 509, 346 of LeetCode.

**Thoughts**: Not the most productive day, not happy at all but keeping the LeetCode streak is vital, I spect to finish 4 homeworks tomorrow and use the whole Thursday, Friday for research (and LeetCode).

## Day 78, Mar 18th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished my 'essay' on graph databases for the research-based learning activity, it took me quite some more time than expected, but finished it anyway. Finished my fifth homework of intelligent systems, went up in kaggle from 6 to 1 (for now, obvi), and was really fun. Started my sixth homework and yep, did not finished the 4 I wanted.

**Thoughts**: Lost my streak on LeetCode, I'm feeling super tired, maybe tomorrow I will continue, maybe only finish my homeworks, I need to rest, although I'm not sick I don't have too much energy.

## Day 79, Mar 19th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished my sixth homework of intelligent systems, improved just a little bit over last homework, still in first place (for now).

**Thoughts**: Wasn't on the mood really, I'm feeling so tired, may take a 'day off' just covering the bare minimum for this challenge, taking advantage that there is no workload for now and the closest not-finished homework deadline is Thursday 26 (besides research).

## Day 80, Mar 20th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Took my day off, only watched some YouTube videos about software trends of 2020, about web development, ML/AI, interviews, etc.

**Thoughts**: Recovered some energy, may take half day off tomorrow and I think I'll be fully replainished for classes and work.

## Day 81, Mar 21st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Started new Udemy course, on Reinforcement Learning that promised to be out-of-the-box and not like the others, so I decided to give it a try, and so far I think it's a meh, for now, not my favorite, not the worst. Basically what I learnt was the explore-exploit applications and some methors like Bayesian/Thompson Sampling, Upper Confidence Bound and navie Epsilon-Greedy.

**Thoughts**: Pretty meh, some things are not explained at all or just vaguely explained, but other things are quitely good explained.

## Day 82, Mar 22nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish my research homework but failed horribly, basically did no progress at all, other than cleaning some unnecesary files and stablishing analogies, I really now what to do but I cannot do it, don't know why.

**Thoughts**: I failed, awfully.

## Day 83, Mar 23rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Did mi intelligent system's exam, did pretty well, I studied a lot for it, I'm very proud of it. Postponed my research homework for Wednesday, I feel terrible about it, I think I'm failing me and my mentor.

**Thoughts**: I really want to be better at time management, no more distractions. I'm getting desperate.

## Day 84, Mar 24th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Nailed it, took me longer than expected but finished my progress on research, feels good. Did my advanced databases exam and I gotta way it was super easy, or maybe I studied a lot, but I finished it in 15 minutes and got a perfect score.

**Thoughts**: This semester will be high greades, fortunatly for my GPA, I expect +95/100.

## Day 85, Mar 25th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my compiler exam, I works completely and it's good, but, I need to separate reserved words and other stuff individually, they are, for now, mixed together, just for testing.

**Thoughts**: It was pretty fun, actually, enjoyed a lot doing it.

## Day 86, Mar 26th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Finished my compilers exam, It was pretty fun, flex is really interesting, can't wait to start using yacc. Found bugs with my professor in my work of research, we hunted some but thre are some remaining, I'll address it tomorrow to keep going forward.

**Thoughts**: I don't know why I can't sleep well, and wake up feeling good the next day and be productive, I'm so tired of it.

## Day 87, Mar 27th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Hunted some bugs in Simod, still work to do, sigh, I just want to integrate the new SplitMiner and the Simulator from my colleagues. Continued my journey on OpenCV, with video basics, like connecting the camera or using video files, and drawing live on camera, this will be somewhat 'useless' for my project, because we will use simple images, but it was fun nonetheless.

**Thoughts**: This whole situation makes me nervous, I lose concentration really easy.

## Day 88, Mar 28th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Went reckless and relentless with OpenCV, since I wasn't on the mood really for finishig correcting Simod, learned a lot, basically, all the basics of object detection, including template matching, 2 different approaches for corner detection, edge detection, grid detection, contour detection, feature matching and a super cool algorithm called watershed, and some introduction to face detection.

**Thoughts**: This OpenCV thing is really interesting, unfortunatly I can't think of a unique project to do by myself.

## Day 89, Mar 29th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Simod fully debugged and almos fully-automated for Scylla simulation execution. Phew, took a while, and some errors were insane, like, typos that broke everything, or missing tags that I totally missed to lookout.

**Thoughts**: Finally, I made it, I can rest peacefully at night.

## Day 90, Mar 30th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: More theory on compilers, on FIRST and FOLLOW functions useful for syntactic recognizers, very interesting theory, cannot wait to apply it to my interpreter with Bison. More theory on Intelligent Systems, on statistics for ML models, comparing 1 vs 1, 1 vs all and all vs all, very interesting topic, also, the professor gave us full insight about Covid-19 in our city, with predictions based on SEIR model with data from a lot of sources, pretty scary, but interesting aswell. Delivered my part to my professor on research, but again, another trouble, works son the GUI but not in CLI, neet to figure it out.

**Thoughts**: Mixed feelings with the Intelligent Systems class, not about the professor or the way he teaches, but the topic of covid, it all seems so unrealistic, like, dystopic.

## Day 91, Mar 31st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: A lot learnt on Advanced Databases, on how to use MySQL with triggers, stored procedures, functions, events, varaiables, and other nice stuff, pretty fun class, have a lot to do from homework, brightside, we can use any language for backend and frontend, meaning, Angular + Node.js.

**Thoughts**: Getting mentally ready for 30-Day LeetCode Challenge.

## Day 92, Apr 1st 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my database first homework, I made all the steps needed for a procedure but encapsulation (in the actual procedure) is needed, pretty fun tho. Started the LeetCode Challenge on 30 Days, done the problem 136 (challenge) and the follow up, 137. Struggled with my reseach 'task', I can perform it the 'easy' way but not in the 'right' way.

**Thoughts**: 1 problem a day looks easy, but consistency is key, for now it's pretty simple, but I bet the last days will take up several minutes on hard problems.

## Day 93, Apr 2nd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 202, it was 'tricky', but overall it was fun. Got more Compilers homework, that actually looks not fun at all, sadly. More theory on Intelligent Systems, with Bayesian Networks, looks cool, kinda similar to DecisionTrees, I'm excited to do the new homework. Back to my job, since the client took way too long to respond (since it's a hospital, with this pandemic sure they have a lot of work), some slight modifications where done to financial reports.

**Thoughts**: Consistency is key.

## Day 94, Apr 3rd 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 53, it was familiar, I knew the best specific algorithm for the problem, the Kadane's Algorithm, so it was 'easy' for me to solve it, most of these problems are super easy to solve usigin a lot of time and a lot of memory, the real challenge is to use the fastest and the one with the lower memory consumption. Finished my database homework my procedure, it works as spected, I'm really happy about the result. Also, discussed with my team about the project, we have roles now and the milestones for it, it will be a nice project, I'll work on the backend and the frontend with Angular, Node, Postgres, and MongoDB.

**Thoughts**: It was a fun day, I'm looking for resources to have better results at kaggle on NLP on detecting spam emails, because I'm really unhappy with the results.

## Day 95, Apr 4th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 283, I think, overall it has good difficulty, it feels like we are upgrading, also did 1303 just because. More documentation and explanation on the databases project, also created the template on Angular and soon I will make the backend and integrate them both, should not take more than a couple of hours. Learnt about ApolloCache, read a lot and searched for infomation on how to implement it on Angular, for my surprise, I realized that had to be done on the backend...waste of hours

**Thoughts**: This LeetCode Challenge could build me up a habit, happy about it.

## Day 96, Apr 5th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 122, quite interesting, not super hard not super easy, was somewhat familiar to me, and it has a lot of variats I would like to solve, because they range from easy to hard, also did 1350 to practice SQL. I missed CodeJam, I dunno why, I registered and set my calendar but I did not get notified and realized it was this day in the evening, so I watched some summaries solving the problems, they seem quite challenging, I know competitive programming is different than interview questions, but they look so different from regular LeetCode problems.

**Thoughts**: Recovering energy for the week, that is going to be super though.

## Day 97, Apr 6th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 49, I was 'easy' in brute force but I was thinking all the posibilities to make it pure O(n) and didn't found a solution, turned out, it basically the fastest is O(nk)-ish more like O(nlogn) with O(n) in memory. Did my 7th homework in intelligent systems with very dissapointing results, Bayesian Networks performed super bad, I don't know if it failed for my features or the way I treated the missing values, but I was expecting better results, I might vectorize all and do SVM, but proooooobably not in Weka but only nltk and scikit learn, using my computer and not my laptop. Worked more with the database homework, since it was an unbalanced amount of work, I helped with a trigger and it was pretty fun. Worked with Angular, adding functionalities, now, the hospital can handle urgencies and improved medical services (more data).

**Thoughts**: Happy with my work with Angular, leart new form validation mechanics and another way to bind data other than ngmodel.

## Day 98, Apr 7th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem actually unknown, I searched in the overall pool of problems and did not found it, followed the hints on LeetCode since I was not sure I fully understood the problem, at the end, after the hints I was right and was a successfull upload, also did problems 1351 and 1365. Also did my part of the database project, the first milestone, the backend of the login with Node and MongoDB, with crypted password and jwt, tomorrow will ad the frontend in Angular.

**Thoughts**: Took it 'easy' today, I was feeling really stressed but I'm good in my timings, everythig acording to the plan.

## Day 99, Apr 8th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 876, linked list, find the middle value, pretty easy to be honest, solved the right way since it was 100% faster and 100% less memory on C++, also did 1085, 586 and 100. Did the frontend part of the login and register for the project, I really like Angular, it's just perfect for me. Also tried to work on my job, but the project is really big and got lost between files I thought I had to modify and in the end I could finish my task so I asked for help and guidance to my superior. Advanced a little bit on my article-like report on relational vs graph databases.

**Thoughts**: So close I can taste it, the 100th day.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 100, Apr 9th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 844, that was somewhat string manipulation but it can be done just by iterating and keeping some record on variables, did no more problem, I felt **really** bad today, had terrible headaches. Finished my task on my job, with guidance on where the files are was easier and more enjoyable. And yeah, 100 days...

**Thoughts**: Really proud of my self, time to step up and do #365DaysOfCode, and I actually have the perfect thing to step up the game. From now on, I will do at least 3 problems on LeetCode and I will do the Junior Training Sheet for competitive programming, with about 950 problems (didn't have enough with LeetCode right?), it estimated to last 750-900 hours to finish it, so it will be a nice challenge alongside my classes, my reseach, my job, my goals, my hobbies and personal study. Oh, and I will upload to GitHub every single problem solved, alongisde my datasheet that tracks my times on reading, thinking, coding, debuggin ans status about submissions. Next level will demand the most of myself, but I know with self discipline I can achieve anything.

## Day 101, Apr 10th 2020:

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 155, a 'system design' on a stack that also tracks the minimum number, I was fun, also did another problem, 141, a [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/ "Official site") classic. Started the Junior Training sheet, did 3 problems, 677-D2-A, 634-D2-A and 112-D2-A, just to warmup and see how it works, I'm very excited about it.

**Thoughts**: I spent a few hours on home chores, and also talking and playing with my friend (via [Discord]()). Wasn't a very productive day, I neet to turbo up for the weekend to finish my research task and keep studying and practicing
