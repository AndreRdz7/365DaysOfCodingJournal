# 365DaysOfCodeJournal

In this repository I will document the progress, results and outputs of this challenge I'm making.
150 Days completed !!  
I will document a wide range of activities, including but not limited to reading, tutorials, lessons, university assingments, side projects, work, problem solving, research and everything related to coding/programming I do.

---

## Day 1, Jan 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: pointer's declaration, access, storage, dereference, arithmetic, also dynamic memory allocation and passing pointers to functions, returning pointers from functions, references, L and R-values in C++.Gulp JS crash course including moving and copying files, concatenating files, minify (uglyfy) files, and optimize images.

**Thoughts**: I've been learnign C++ lately and it feels so powerful, yet, kinda simple to use, since I really learned how to code in C, it feels quite familiar, however there are some importante differences I will encounter lately. Pointers look really low level, since it's kind of interacting with hardware, it gives me the sensation of power and control of what I want to do, it's really interesting. Gulp is a handy tool, a nice understanding of what I can do to enhance workflows, I don't it's a _MUST_ in the knowledge baggage, but sure it won't hurt to learn a little bit deeper.

## Day 2, Jan 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: OOP in C++: classes, constructors, initialization list, delegation of constructors, copy constructors, class member manipulation, shallow vs deep copying, move constructors with l-value and r-value parameters, public vs private, methods, destructors, friends of class, static classes, 'this' pointer. LeetCoded in the Microsoft Top Questions, solving 4 problems in Arrays and Strings cathegory (since it's a paid feature of LeetCode, I cannot provide further details on the problem's number or description).

**Thoughts**: I learnt about OOP about 2.5 years ago, coded in Java, and I was somewhat familiar with OOP in C++ since I was familiar with C structs and OOP overall, I think it's always good to reinforce the foundations of coding once in a while, and since I will be using Unreal Engine soon to do a guided videogame, an OOP "crash course" comes in handy. After OOP there are 4 topics left, smart pointers, error handling, streams and STL; I'm really excited about the STL section, It will benefit me a lot for problem solving.

## Day 3, Jan 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to GraphQL, querying, nested querying, babel setup for projects, ES6 import/export and a small API example of a query returning a simple string.

**Thoughts**: A little break from C++ as I don't want to overload me with a specific topic, since I've been done waaay more than an hour on the challenge, so the next topic I'm into (besides AI/ML wich I will start on Monday 6) is GraphQL, in my past job I worked with it by doing queries, mutations and subscriptions, but now I'm looking for knowledge in design and creation of GQL APis. I kinda have a previous experience _doing_ GQL, I did it with Absinthe for an Elixir backend, but it was kind of a mess and It didn't workout properly.

## Day 4, Jan 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Data types on GQL, custom types (class like), operation arguments, array manipulation, simple relational data and by arrays.

**Thoughts**: Imagine the data as a graph is much more simpler than thought at first glance, we can even think of it as a "relational database" that can be cyclical and can access a lot of information as long as it's related without thinking about all inner joins of tables, and where clauses on queries etc. I think GQL is truly the future of APIs, I don't think it will be the norm for this year, but I have a gut feeling that most small companies and even large companies will start to create and/or migrate their apis to GQL, since these API's can be accesed with a client like Altair (on browser) or Postman.

## Day 5, Jan 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. operations) in GQL, custom defined input types for mutations leading to a better and more undestandable code, babel configuration of plugins.

**Thoughts**: Been familiar with mutations in graphql only on the frontend, on the backend it looks way more interesting and I think this part is another example of the power of GQL and why it's the future. Tomorrow I will start to add Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to this challenge.

## Day 6, Jan 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a new journey in the world of research, I enrolled in a _R&D_ career path on my university, where I will work with profesors all around the world to perform research and develop new, innovative and open source projects, I'm starting to familiarize with the project, _grosso modo_ it consist of Business Process Simulations with automatization and enhancement of parameters in orden to obtain the most realistic simulation possible with the given data logs. I will be working with Python and Jupyter notebooks in the future of this project. Re-started my AI journey with Q-Learning, getting the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, the Bellman equation and Markov decision processes, I have 3 papers to read to go deeper and fully understand the concepts, I will read them tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: This research "course" looks very interesting and very promising, I will be working with at least 3 PhD professors and I finally will be involved on this career path that I've been dreaming on.

## Day 7, Jan 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read 'Reinforcement Learning I: Introduction' from Richard Sutton ad Andrew Barto; onto AI, the policy vs plan of reinforcement learning, the 'living penalty', full Q-learning intuition and the temporal difference. Added 2 papers to my to read list.

**Thoughts**: I honestly was expecting a lot more from Hadelin de Ponteves and Kiril Eremenko, since I listen to thoir SuperDataScience podcast (which I love) and I have been enrolled in one of their courses previously and they were really good (in my opinion), but this one feels so shallow, don't get me wrong, it's explained in a way many people can understand without a super background on mathematics or computer science, but it lacks on awe-inspiring content. The paper was also really well written, not to technical not too casual with some examples that anyone can understand.

## Day 8, Jan 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on trial and error, simulations and mostly exploration of the tools Signavio, BIMP and Simod, in order to comprehend what the programs are doing and analizing the data outputs by the given inputs.

**Thoughts**: Business Process Modeling is a hot topic in Europe, mostly in research universities and being part of many PhD students, I'm currently working with one PhD professor and indirectly with other 3 located in different parts of the world, so this is going to be very enriched learning.

## Day 9, Jan 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked with my professor from research developing a mxml to xes parser in Java (repo will be available tomorrow) in order to start creating 'pipelines' from Signavio to Simod and verifying everything works correctly to start adding functionalities to Simod in a forked repository. Full description of Deep Q-Learning (Q-Learning + ANN) on the Udemy course, covering topics like learning, acting, experience replay and action selection policies (epsilon greedy, epsilon soft, softmax).

**Thoughts**: Didn't remember how powerfull is java, specially on older formats of data, we worked with .jar libraries that helped us a lot, but finding them was kinda tricky, since we had to "scrap" a little bit into OpenXES and other websites to get the right compatible library.

## Day 10, Jan 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked many hours trying to figure out how the notebook works and find why it does not work with other inputs rather than the provided. At the end, slight modifications where done and from now on, my forked repository will be the one I will be working on.

**Thoughts**: Reading other people's code (even Python) can be tricky if not documented properly, my goal is to document any progress I do and eventually, document the previous work done.

## Day 11, Jan 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched many hours of tutorials on Adobe XD to improve my prototyping/sketching and UI/UX notions on web.

**Thoughts**: It's a super nice to use tool, It's a shame it is not available for Ubuntu (my main OS), fortunately I have a Windows laptop so I can learn it and use it. It really feels like a drag and drop website builder, wish I had learnt this before.

## Day 12, Jan 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Operator overloading theory,overloading asingment operator (copy and move), overloading operators as member functions, overloading operators as global functions and overloading the stream insertion and extraction operators.

**Thoughts**: Wow, I think this is some next level C++, it's actually not a thing that one will normally use in a program, it has specific use cases and definetly comes in worthy in large scale projects. I find very interesting to overload "native" functionalities from a language to do whatever you want to do (as long as it keeps it's arity).

## Day 13, Jan 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Inheritance concept, terminology and notation, composition, deriving classes, protected members and class access, constructors and destructors (super constructors).

**Thoughts**: This looks like some serious OOP advantage over common procedural programming. I'm currently thinking of learning some Qt for C++ UI and build something great that uses everything I've learnt so far, but, I want to finish this course first and then learn the basics of Qt while building something nice.

## Day 14, Jan 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Keeping up with inheritance...passing arguments to base class constructos, copy/move constructos and operator '=' with derived classes, redefinig bases class methods (kinda like 'overloading', where the same name does other thing), multiple inheritance (just scratched the surface of the concept, no work done on this secction).

**Thoughts**: Multiple inheritance looks amazing, I'm eager to learn more aboout it, I'm honestly dissapointed the course does not cover it well, but at least it developed curiosity in me to learn more about that topic, seems more tedious (higher levels of abstraction, maybe things will be way too general to make it work) than complex to implement it.

## Day 15, Jan 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to AI, onto Deep Q-Learning, starting the process of the environment design, using kivy for the UI, defining initial states on the goal from the starting point. The environment consist of a car trying to reach a corner startring from the opposite corner, the 'lane' consists of a non-straigth path sorrounded by sand, where it 'slows' the car and gives penalty to the AI. The car has angle and rotation properties to properly turn to reach the goal, it has 3 sensors, that detects objects in the front, the left and the right, as well as 3 signals that are triggered by them. It also has many functions that update the movility given the last state and the environment, choosing the best option given by the AI. I penalyzes hitting on walls (edge of map) and it's countered by the sensors and updating the direction of the car (since it can only go forward). The penalty of hitting walls and drive away from the wall are the heaviest, while doing some progress it's a tenth of positive reward equivalent to the worst penalty. The main libraries for the AI is (obviously) numpy and pytorch. The Network class inherits from the pytorch Neural Network implementation, the input layer will be determined by the input_size parameter, as well ad the output neurons determined by the nb_action parameter, the full connections is the pytorch NN are fully connected by the Linear constructor giving the output of a Neural Network input(5) -> 30 hidden -> 30 hidden -> output(3). The forward function (for forward propagation) works on the state given by the environment, by using a rectifier function (RELU) to activate the neurons on the first hidden layer and getting the q values from the second hidden layer with the previous activations. Last but not least, the experience replay implemented as a class, constructed by the last 100 transitions memory space and the memory (list of events).

**Thoughts**: A 'environmentless' model will make the car act like a mad insect, just roaming around without directions (except from avoid the borders), it is reduced to a mere random movement. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch makes AI so much easier to implement, just import it, create it and use it.

## Day 16, Jan 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implementation the 'queue-like' functionality on the ReplayMemory, alongside with the random memory access to get a batch-sized sample to map them into pytorch variables. For the creation of the model class (Deep Q-Learning) some initializations are required from the previous classes, and a gamma variable that is used to discount the reward as the time passes (the more actions the model does the lower the reward will be) and the creation of the Adam optimized binded to the model (Pytorch NN) with a learning rate of 0.001 and a memory (ReplayMemory) with a capacity of a hundred thousand. Using softmax and multinomial functions we are able to not always choose the best action, and do some exploration, the Temperature variable is set to 7 to ensure it acts more 'car-like' than 'insect-like', of course with the highest probability of choosing the best option. The learn is where all of the Q-Learning math happens, starting with outputs calculation given the batch state, predicting the next outputs with the highest q value, calculating our target with the previuosly defined gamma value, using the smooth_l1_loss to calculate our temporal difference, reset our optimized, perform a backpropagation and the using the optimizer to update the weights of the Neural Network.

**Thoughts**: Felt like a 0-60 in 3.6 seconds, really interesting how pytorch interacts with it's own variables and functions, I think is handcrafted with love and passion and thus making an output of a _great_ library, I'm really happy with the progress and what I am learning, with this code, feels like all the theory behind is really being applied in here.

## Day 17, Jan 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a MXML parser to CSV in order to make qualitative analysis on datasets related to our investigation. Using Pandas to manipulate the CSV and get usefult information.

**Thoughts**: We are going a bit slow on the investigation process, nonetheless we are very motivated to improve and get good results as an extent of that. I'm very excited of what I'm learning, the more days passes I feel more and more comfortable of what I'm doing and its solely because I understanding it further and further.

## Day 18, Jan 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Update function calculated using the last reward and the new signal to process as parameteres, the first thing to do is setting the new action to perform and add it to the memory with the push function. Then the action is selected given the new stage and if our memory storage has 100 or more memories, we trigger the learn function on the batches returned, then the last action is updated with the currect action, as well as the state, and the reward; the reward window is extended with the last reward, if the length exceeds 1000, the oldest result is deleted and finally returns the action so the program can perform it and repeat the process again. The score is calculated by calculating the mean of the reward window. To save the progress of the AI a save and load functions are implemented using PyTorch save dictionary. Read the theory of dynamic programming of Richard Bellman but did not understandit at 100%, there was a few math notation and concepts I'm totally unrelated to and had a though time actually, maybe later in the year, with more knowledge, I can better understand it.

**Thoughts**: Oh yes, a fully functional AI model with graphic representation, very happy for it! nevertheless I did not make it with my own hands, I'm planning to expand it and make it "smarter" in with way more sensors and variables, perhaps even speed, acceleration and many other stuff. I love Formula 1, so making an AI capable of achieve the best track path on the 22 circuits of this year's season will be a dream come true.

## Day 19, Jan 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to one of my favourite things, UX/UI. A basic canvas for mocking on mobile and how to use my smartphone to actually test it and see how it responds. Some more Adobe XD features.

**Thoughts**: Not really much today, been a little bit tired and unmotivated, dunno why actually.

## Day 20, Jan 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to the research, I was working hard on undestand concepts and finally came with a new updated parser that solved many problems we did not realize were happening, from MXML to XES.

**Thoughts**: A step up in the research, since we are trying to find an algorith to get the most accurate calendars of work.

- [MXMLtoXES](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/MXMLtoXES "Updated")

## Day 21, Jan 21st 2020

**Today's Progress**: More from UX/UI, now with colors and text/fonts, for better presentation, good contrasts, even gradients, not much theory of colors or something like that, was pretty much an Adobe XD tutorial on colors, kinda dissapointed, the best part was the realistic buttons. New courses from my semester! I'll learn advanced databases, intelligent systems, compilers and computer vision, as well as keep making progress on research.

**Thoughts**: Need to go back to GraphQL and C++, finish them up as well as this and focus on AI and ML. Very happy and excited about the new semester, looks awesome, and I will commit to it a 100%, will be my best semester.

## Day 22, Jan 22nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Wanted a break from everything, so I searched in my Learnathon YouTube playlist something interesting and fount a video of Pug, wich is a HTML preprocessor in Node.js that basically turns HTML into a programming language with loops, conditionals, cases, mixins, etc.

**Thoughts**: Very interesting, highly recommend it to watch it at least for curiosity, just to know there is something out there called Pug that makes HTML more enjoyable.

## Day 23, Jan 23rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Heavy on research, made an Jupyter Notebook to make data exploration and read a _very_ interesting chapter of a really nice book written by Marlon Dumas, et. al., wich is a professor I will be working on indirectly, probably will meet him soon. The notebook are some basics of Pandas, I'm planning to get way better at pandas to make it a toolkit that I can handle, not only for this project, but for ML in general.

**Thoughts**: The book is written amazingly, fully understand it every single concept, maybe because I'm way more familiar with the topic and had previous knowledge of it, but I think anyone can understant it, highly recommend it if interested on the topic.

## Day 24, Jan 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dynamic polymorphism, Base class pointers, virtual functions and destructors, override specifier, Base class references and Abstract classes as Interfaces.

**Thoughts**: The big concept of static vs dynamic I had in C++ was memory allocation for storage, never imagined that could be applied to so many things, ranging from constructors and destructors and virtual functions. I'm awed of the versatillity and power C++ provides, what most people say is that is super hard typed, memory picky, strict, hard to handle, obsolete and way less useful than it used to be (well, this could be true tho), but I think is that maybe they are missing a lot, I'm getting **_way_** behind my goal in LeetCode, but I will definetly solve as much problems as humanly possible with all my other stuff only in C++.

## Day 25, Jan 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to work, read a lot of the new React code on my job and did a little bit of changes, merele aesthetic, wich will be all of my work for this week, make the page look beautiful.

**Thoughts**: Need to step up my organizing game to make my dreams come true, almost a month gone and I feel my progress is 0, maybe because the first 2 weeks I was so emotionally bad and my lack of progress just made it worse, but I'm so much better now.

## Day 26, Jan 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Full on research today, managed to complete my task of data wrangling on the log.csv file generated by BIMP upon a .bpmn file created in Signavio. managed to use Pandas to create graphics and easily visualize the data so assuptions can be made.

**Thoughts**: Feeling making some progress!! super excited to move forward and go deeper in the analysis, I'm really really happy.

- [BPM Calendar Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/BPM_Calendar "Anaconda/Jupyter required")

## Day 27, Jan 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Adobe XD functionalities like drawing custom icons (ideal for apps), stokes and lines, pen tool. Tips on how to work with Adobe Illustrator and InDesign alongside XD.

**Thoughts**: Feels werid-ish, not quite that happy with today's work, since I don't have Illustrator nor InDesign and as a Software Engineer my main task is to plan, code and execute, my graphic design habilities are far beneath the siol, so this came weird for me, I know some UI needs to bee done with more than CSS and Google Images, but this is really not for me.

## Day 28, Jan 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: A lot of discussion with my professor on where we should take the research, we are taking the right path and going on with a nice pace, our aim is to publish a paper for the BPM 2020 in Sevilla, Spain, with me as a coauthor for the paper. And with me as the lead and only author for a demo paper on my work to attend and do a speech at the same conference. Another options we are aiming are ICPM in Italy, CIC anc MICAI in Mexico. Updated the previous notebook to include hours in the schedule tracker.

**Thoughts**: Can't be more excited for my progress, I will put a 200% more effort to make thinks right.

## Day 29, Jan 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More progress on my applied research, on methods of calculating effective working hours when a log is given. More details will be displayed on the paper I will be co-author, for now, I'll just explain in a nutshell the progress.

**Thoughts**: We are about 1 and a half month to the deadline of the paper submission, we are very excited for our progress.

## Day 30, Jan 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More progress on my applied research, using a combined data of the event types of starting and completing tasks, an aproximate schedule is set for the minimum hour in the log and the maximum hour in the log, and their respective day, no assumptions are made that the resources work con continued days and at the same hours, but most of the software for simulation, including Simod (what we will upgrade) has this limitations of starting and ending day and starting and ending hour, there cannot be flexible schedules like Monday 8-10, Wednesday 8-12 and Friday 9-13; we understand the mayority of the industry runs fixed schedules, specially the ones that have logs, so for now, we will focus on fixed schedules but we leave the door open for flexible schedules. Just to relax myself did some CodeWars Katas on C++.

**Thoughts**: The progress that we had was... not what actually was needed, the actual logs does not contais a json object we were trying to insert on the XES file, so another approach needs to be done. Some CodeWars progress made (8 kyo to 7 kyo on C++) but I need to start doing LeetCode daily !! I need to better organize my time.

## Day 31, Jan 31st 2020

**Today's Progress**: I discussed with my professor and we decided we need to upgrade our simulation tools, we kindly asked Abel (BIMP creator) to make some updates on his software, while he decides to update it or not, we are contemplating to use an open source one and have another researcher to upgrade it to our needs. Some extensions on Simod forked repository, for calendar creations, not only default and 24/7, work still in progress.

**Thoughts**: Going strong, one and a half month to go. At this pace we will make it to BPM 2020. I'm really happy.

## Day 32, Feb 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Deep Convolutional Q-Learning tutorial to make an AI play Doom, it's very interesting how 'easy' is to make an AI to 'see' and learn from it, since I will be taking a Computer Vision course at the university this semester, I'm planning to make something with AI for the final project. Startes the A3C intuition, the best _yet_ AI algorithm provided by Google.

**Thoughts**: AI is such a fantastic topic, my research is focused on Data Mining and Data Visualization (moreless), so I'm planning to maybe go big, further and beyond and trying to integrate some algorithms to improve the dathered data.

## Day 33, Feb 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Busy day, but I managed to learn/code for +1hr, sticking to my goals, back to GraphQL, onto mutations and proper folder structure.

**Thoughts**: Without messing with the database, GQL looks pretty easy (at least for now, I know subscriptions aka sockets are one tricky boi to implement), I'm really happy that I made progress even with a day full of chores and responsabilities.

## Day 34, Feb 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Consistency is key, that's why I managed to organize myself and finish the GraphQL basics, finishing the mutations with the updates and the subscriptions (sockets) that turned out to be quite easier to implement in the backend than in the frontend (previous experience).

**Thoughts**: Really happy about the progress, I'll continue on the weekend, since I need urgently to work on React on the Logic1 part and my research. Been way more tired lately, I'm starting to get worried.

## Day 35, Feb 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked in the Simod notebook, specifically on the calendar creation, where only default values were available (24/7 & 9to5MonToFri). A lot of trial and error since it was not documented and the names are not quite as descriptive, specially the widget part.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a lot, but, was worth it, I'm starting to feel this project is mine (of course, in a non possesive way, I know it is not my work, but I really like being a part of).

## Day 36, Feb 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Apparently what I did was wrong, well, if not wrong, was unnecesary for the moment, I misunderstood a bit my professor, but, the project is not broken, just "wasted" a weekend. Worked with Scylla, a simulator (replacing BIMP in our workflow) to check the calendars, comparing the default (9 to 5, Monday to Friday) with a custom variation, turns out, the notebook (BPM Calendar) works as spected, so It will be integrated to the Simod notebook as a function, the thing is.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a lot, but, was worth it, I'm starting to feel this project is mine (of course, in a non possesive way, I know it is not my work, but I really like being a part of).

## Day 37, Feb 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Great progress made in the research, my output was as espected. The purpose of the BPM Calendar notebook is finally reached, retrieving a Calendar, it's next iteration will be getting the amount of resources. Started the XML creator, given the output of the previous notebook, it will create an XML configuration file for Scylla, and repeat the simulation in a pipeline, were we will determine the actual calendar of the resources.

**Thoughts**: Felt great it worked, needs refactoring, cleaning and documentation, but I'm really happy nevertheless.

## Day 38, Feb 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my winter intensive courses in college, I'm feeling **really** tired, dunno why, but somehow managed to do 1+ hr on this challenge on upgrading the GraphQL environment with Prisma, a DB mounted on Heroku and using Docker.

**Thoughts**: It is great how many technologies are integrated in a such a simple project.

## Day 39, Feb 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the calendar functionality on the BPM Calendar notebook, a full month of work in applied research, down to few lines of code. Upgraded de XML Creator but I can't get it to work properly.

**Thoughts**: Many many hours of work reduced to a single small notebook, feeling proud of me and my professor.

## Day 40, Feb 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Struggled a lot trying to make my work done on Logic1 responsive, I don't understand why some pages are fully responsive and others simply look awful, I need help from my colleague [JC](https://github.com/JCVelazco "GH Profile").

**Thoughts**: Feels bad to not improve my previous work, honestly.

## Day 41, Feb 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished XML Creator for Scylla configuration, my professor is very satisfied with my work, and I'm very proud of it, I have put onto it many many hours and the reward is actually tangible. Next step will be to make it a pipeline and decide the direction of the research paper based on the 'recently' published (similar topic) from belgium researchers. Finished some little topics on Prisma on my journy on GraphQL, next step will be Authentication. New semester beggins, with Compilers and Intelligent Systems looking very promising.

**Thoughts**: Had some anxiety lapses on December and January due to the fact I reached the final round on Microsft for intern and did not get an offer, I knew since then that I needed to practice and study more, nevertheless, I feel less and less motivated everyday to do Interview Problems, even tho landing a job on Microsoft is what I want the most right now. On a happier topic, I'm feeling very proud of myself for the reasearch progress.

## Day 42, Feb 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More new classes, Computer Vision: learnt some theory behind what it does and the building blocks of CV, on Advanced Databases, by my own, watched a long video about SQL queries, to refresh my memory.

**Thoughts**: More promising courses, I have high hopes for this semester, I will deliver my best at every class.

## Day 43, Feb 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: New analysis on the BPM Calendar notebook, on a new .csv file from a real source (not simulated), however, the output was not as spected, the amount of resources was way too high and the data was so messy, we need to do first a role discovery based on the Simod notebook to further clean the data. Added to the XML Creator a file writing functionality.

**Thoughts**: No BPM Sevilla, Spain, sinche Marlon will be part of the chair, we cannot send our paper ther, however, we will send it to a magazine, wich (as stated by my professor) will be much better for him and for me, so no more deadline on March 26th. I will still output the most out of me.

## Day 44, Feb 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More compilers theory, of how the general pipeline works, some topics on lexical analysis and semantic analysis. A review of Chomsky hierarchy and formal languages. More ML fundamentals, on the features classification (quantitative and qualitative), and some golden rules like: "Do not modify your data to make it fit for an algorithm and learn to work with incomplete data". How supervised algorithms are validated with techniques like k-fold cross-validation and random cross-validation.

**Thoughts**: I know I've been in this semester for a week, but it looks the best so far, I'm really really happy.

## Day 45, Feb 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More progress on discovering how to improve Simod, now we know the mid-output part of the process, it will be mixed with my BPM Calendar notebook and the feature I added to Simod to further create the calendars by Role (not resource) and go further with our research.

**Thoughts**: I spent many hours into it, because the code that simod.py uses is spread across many many files and it's not very well documented, sadly.

- [BPM Calendar Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/BPM_Calendar "Anaconda/Jupyter required")

## Day 46, Feb 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basics of Matplotlib file displaying, as well as OpenCV image read concepts, and some drawing functions.

**Thoughts**: I'm super excited about my CV class, so I decided to take a little step forward to anticipate some of the usage of OpenCV with Python, since my professor will be using MATLAB.

## Day 47, Feb 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Since we are competing with another work, we decided to make a deep insight on our competence, so I read the article published by Elsevier on ScienceDirect. Apparently, what we are trying to do is moreless already done by them, but not exactly, and it's performed in R, and it's virtually no documented at all, not even a Readme, so it was really though figuring out what the code was doing (specially because I'm not quite familiar with R, just a few ML examples on it).

**Thoughts**: The expectations are high, and our competence is fierce, the paper was published last year but not that long ago, the code hasn't been updated since "the last" commit that it is actually named 'initial commit', so probably it will be abandoned, this gives us a window to improve our research and perform better with automatation and a GUI.

## Day 48, Feb 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Upgraded the XML writter in order to parse Simod's output on calendars into XML for Scylla, not that hard of a task but rather a little bit of time consuming, fun nonetheless.

**Thoughts**: I know this work will be 'useless' as soon as my colleague [Antonio Sánchez](https://github.com/ansacaa "GH Profile") finishes the new, upgraded and better version of scylla, but in python (not an executable jar file), but this will help me to improve my skills and code better and faster once the new versions of the simulator and splitminer are released.

## Day 49, Feb 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Long chapter reading on database transactions theory, it was a lot of content, I learn't a lot of things like issues that can occurr on concurrent access on databases, how to handle them and the event log completness, recoverability, serializability and what information should include.

**Thoughts**: Such an interesting topic, and I think it should be included in basic DB courses, because normally, real world databases will have concurrency.

## Day 50, Feb 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time doing work on the research, by mkaing the notebook better on how Simod works and adding a threshold support value to the schedules to 'mark' them correct. Tried to integrate Scylla to Simod, but the reference of Simo 1.0.0 is even less documented, so many many things were black boxes and configurations varied a lot between versions.

**Thoughts**: Uhh, kinda stuck right now, I actually don't know what to do to fix this, I'll ask my professor.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 51, Feb 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Exercises on regular languages and regular expressions, a little bit of a review from 2 semesters ago. Talked with my professor on what to do now that I reached a wall, so we decided to change the scylla jar we are using to a GUI-less one, since I have the configuration xml writer there should be no problem to execute it, I just need to get the bpmn file from splitminer on Production.xes and figure out the simulation file.

**Thoughts**: Many things to do and don't know where to start, but I better start it now if I want to finishit for Monday.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 52, Feb 21st 2020

**Today's Progress**: More computer vision theory and a little bit of practice on convolution operations, the downside of my course is that the professor uses Matlab, a non production/industry environment, so I use OpenCV and I need to constantly look for code equivalences.

**Thoughts**: Very lazy day actually, but managed to learn some things, repository will be available after deadline for homework.

**Link to Work / References** :

- No Repo Available

## Day 53, Feb 22nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started (and semi-finished) my Intelligent Systems homework, where I need to analyze text and add features using [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/) and [Parallel Dots](https://www.paralleldots.com/) APIs. It was really fun and actually easy to do, just get the key, read the csv and perform the cols iterativeley. The big downsides were the amount of calls and the frequency of calls, Parallel Dots only allows 1000 calls a day within 1 sec each for the free tier, and MeaningCloud 20000 monthly with .5 seconds interval, and for sentiment analysis it uses 2 calls to get the response, so I spent a lot of it, If more work is needed, I may be use another account since I can't afford to pay 80-100 dollars for a homework.

**Thoughts**: Super fun to perform, I enjoyed a lot, once the deadline is met, the repository will be available (without the dataset).

## Day 54, Feb 23rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 'responsiveness' on the Logic1CS webpage I was working on, apparently, jobs done, We are waiting for feedback in order to change, add or even develop new projects with them. Upgraded the Simod calendar recovery and resource pool, the XML creator was redesigned into a python script in order to call it from the notebook, some code cleaning was performed.

**Thoughts**: I think we are slowing down in a very bad way, we were having a great pace but suddenly, the 3 researcher students (including me) had a lot of trouble, More effort needs to be done.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 55, Feb 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More recap on finite automata for my compilers course, feels nice to remember things from 1+ year ago. More work done with Simod, with a better .jar file including the dependencies and how to execute it, it will be used alongside splitminer (yet the java version), the only missing thing is the xml simulation file for scylla, since the configuration is done and the bpmn file will be obtained with splitminer, Maybe I will use the Jupyter Notebook widgets to get some values, I don't want them to be hardcoded. Plus, more lectures on OpenCV and image processing techniques such as image blurring, smoothing and morfological operations and some theory behind the kernels (kinda like filters).

**Thoughts**: Back on track on research and computer vision, feeling with moreless large amounts of energy.

## Day 56, Feb 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked with database desgin, on Entity Relation diagram and design of the system of a wholesale store based on memberships and divided in departments, as part of my advanced databases course to implement transactions. No repo will be available (PHP, PDO, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap project) until the delivery date is met (to avoid plagiarism).

**Thoughts**: This looks fun, It was a long time since I designed a system from scratch.

## Day 57, Feb 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started my homework on computer vision, on image reading, and image and kernel validation, I don't quite fully undestand what the professor is asking so I need to talk to him to finish the homework.

**Thoughts**: Python + CV = Love. Homework is private, repo will be available as soon as the deadline is met.

**Link to Work / References** :

- No Repo Available

## Day 58, Feb 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done my compilers homework, getting regular expressions and their finite automata, the trickiest part was the regex of a languages that do not includes abba as a subword.

**Thoughts**: Spent few minutes on 5 exercises and a lot more on the one mentioned above, felt weird. Since it's a handmade (no code) I don't think I will upload it to GH even after deadline.

**Link to Work / References** :

## Day 59, Feb 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Computer Vision homework, with basically was a hand-made convolution function given a image and a (gaussian) kernel, was not hard, and there are only 5 homeworks in the semester so I hope it gets thougher than this.

**Thoughts**: That was easy, fun nevertheless, repo will be available once deadline is met.

## Day 60, Feb 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Troubleshooting with [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) to convert csv file to arff (weka format), as part of my intelligent systems homework, but not much information is on the internet, some questions are as old as 2012 and didn't help me a lot, I managed to fix some issues, but others, apparently are problems with the content of the data, anyway, I spent many hours on it and didn't get any results.

**Thoughts**: Needless to say, I'm not satisfied, tomorrow will be full research and I'll wait for help from my professor to solve the weka problems.

**Link to Work / References** :

## Day 61, Mar 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Getting the bpmn file out of splitkmines and writing the sim file in xml to provide to scylla, a litte inconveninence was encountered because the part of the process I extracted the xml did not contain their resource and the probability gateways did not have any data, so I have to imporove the file and make it automatic, will be job for tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Finally some advances in research, I know I've said it maybe a lot, but I need to elevate the pace, I don't know whats is happening to me, I cannot focus full time on my things.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 62, Mar 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: My professor is satisfied with my work, automation needs to be done, so I'll work on it. Finally! some code in compiles using flex, it was a hello world like exercise but code is code. On intelligent systems, the theory behing SVM it's awesome, I may use it for the final proyect, using word2vec + SVM, since the final goal is a highscore on kaggle, not the "perfect" model.

**Thoughts**: The ReGex conversor to Deterministic Finite Automata from flex to a c file it's just mind blowing, honestly, when I get to know that such things exists, I convice myself that there are a lot of gifted persons in the world contributing to it.

## Day 63, Mar 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: More theory on Computer Vision, started a Udacity Free Program and in class, I made a challenge with my friend JC to finish the course in 11 weeks, let's see how much we learn together, since we are team in the CV course con college.

**Thoughts**: Still not very productive, getting distracted a lot, I'm desperate!.

## Day 64, Mar 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Practiced some SQL Queries by creating the database for the first homework in the university server, with some redesigning to improve performance and make it easier to understand and implement. Tried to progress on the research but the code is so badly documented that sometimes I don't know where to look when I'm trying to find something I need, however, once I got the things I need, I can further work on my part.

**Thoughts**: Feeling ok, getting contacted a lot from LinkedIn, unfortunately, full-time offers outside my posibilities to finish my carreer or it ended up in me not fullfilling requirements (specially 5+ years of experience or so).

**Link to Work / References** :

- [Simod](https://github.com/AndreRdz7/Simod "Forked Simod")

## Day 65, Mar 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Overview of context free grammar and regular grammar in my Compilers class, started my essay in research-based learning for my Database course, learn a lot in my intelligent systems class, on pattern based algorithms, with the great advantage of being human-readable, some theory behind decision trees and association rules.

**Thoughts**: Lots of homework to do, If I haven't, now is time, yes, to or-ga-ni-ze my time properly.

## Day 66, Mar 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some progress on research, tuns out I was doing it not right, I was analyzing data one step ahead than I should, no problem, now I know and my professor is still confident about me and the progress we all are making. Decided that the computer vision project will be sign language recognition, for now, we have letters and numbers both for men and women, but we need full words if we want to make it better.

**Thoughts**: Kinda dissapointed with the CV class, it's really boring, feels like a copy-the-code-understand-it-later-(maybe?).

## Day 67, Mar 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my second homework of Intelligent Systems, consisting in convert a csv file to arff (for Weka) and obtaining insights about the data, I was really fun to watch many many plots and trying to give them the proper interpretation, understand how the data is separated between spam and non spam. Finished my essay on research-based learning.

**Thoughts**: Weka looks really powerfull, yet, feels very limited on what you can do, no doubt is super powerfull and fast, but there is something that doesn't convince me a lot.

## Day 68, Mar 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Super improved my XML writer for the simulation, however, the data it takes it's not "real" and the structure is very convenient for me, but I made it based on my previous interaction with data delivered by Simod, very close to the goal. I'll be back to my past job at Inment Dev becaouse I really need a stronger income for my girlfriend's masters degree, I'll rejoin on Wednesday.

**Thoughts**: I gotta be honest, I'm not super happy to add more stress to my life iwth more workloads but there is no better satisfaction than to see my love succeeding in life and improving herself.

## Day 69, Mar 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yes, finally, the theory on Imbalances class for Machine Learning, the last homework was kind of a nightmare because it was so unbalances that making out conclussions was very hard, but now we are authorized to do undersampling to make it even. Started my database homework on implementing transactions on PDO.

**Thoughts**: .

## Day 70, Mar 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 8 hours doing the homework of PDO, learnt a lot of what NOT to do on php and PDO because at the end it failed, I failed my team and failed to myself.

**Thoughts**: One of the worst days I've ever had, I'm going to redo the whole project and I'll do it the right way this time, with a lot of transactions, triggers, events, etc., to show myself I can with proper preparation and to my professor before the exam (next Tuesday) to improve my grading, so, be on the lookout for that repository.

## Day 71, Mar 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yes back to work, doing Angular (yay!), implementing sketches on financial reports that will make calls from a GraphQL API, very excited to keep working and improving my skills, and also keep supporting my girlfriend. New meeting, new project for CV, no more hand sign recognition, instead it will be a handwrite to speech/text.

**Thoughts**: Yeah, not that excited about the CV project,it was actually based on a hackathon winning project (but with very basic reading, like printing reading) and it's ok for a single person, maybe 2, not for 5.

## Day 72, Mar 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Pushdown automaton theory, feels amazing to remember such things, we will begin to write the final project (interpreter) very very soon). Bagging and Boosting on Machine Learning, learnt the advantages and disadvantages of both tecniques, personally, I thing ML/AI is the most interesting topic that can be related to math and pure computer science right now. FInished the third homework, making knn algorithms with k=3 and k=5 to train in weka and the test it and upload it to Kaggle(private contest).

**Thoughts**: The highest score was .58xxxx, and I personally felt really bad, I was virtually on last place, but then I discovered that all of the other participants used all the features we have mined, not only emotions, that made me feel better because I was the only one that followed the instructions haha.

## Day 73, Mar 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done the 4th homework of intelligent systems, using 4 pattern-based classifiers, I used J48 (Decision Tree), Random Forest, FURIA and REPTRee and the highest perform was .63xxxx by FURIA. Did some other views in my job, about financial utilities for the hospital.

**Thoughts**: Weka is fun to use, but I want to write some code, I don't know, mixed feelings on it. I love my job, home office + angular, I can't ask for more right now.

## Day 74, Mar 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Done some lectures in Udacity about Computer Vision, very interesting by the way, a little bit more of GraphQL (because I need to finish it ASAP, I really like the topic and want to finish it).

**Thoughts**: My rest day, organized my next week and recovered my energy, but of course, keeping the challenge up by doing at least one hour, feeling proud, I'm almost 80% of the challenge until upgrading it to 365.

## Day 75, Mar 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added 5 more features to my dataset for Intelligent Systems, using the abhorrend parallel dots API, adding the intent of the text (spoiler, I'm very dissapointed with the results), in order to do homework 5 and 6 tomorrow. Done a full summary for the Intelligent System's exam, although it will be next week.

**Thoughts**: Ah yes, Coronavirus, I'm quarantined and the best thing to do is to feed my brain, I'll have a very busy week doing a lot of homework, working in my research, working in my job and yes, LeetCoding (I will, I promise, you'll see).

## Day 76, Mar 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish my Intelligent Systems' homework, unfortunatly, although I managed to create cost matrix for CostSensitiveClassifier algorithm with FURIA, I couldn't do and undersampling with SpreadSubSample nor an oversampling with SMOTE, because somehow the button to apply those filters specifically was disabled. Finished 3/4 of my homework/exam for compilers, on designing Context Free Grammars and evaluate a Grammar to produce words, the missing part is a flex file that recognizes Java-like numbers, symbols and reserved words, that will be the fun part. Keeping the mood of Databases, did problems 1378, 1350 & 1068 of LeetCode.

**Thoughts**: Very dissapointed with my day, I was expecting to be way waaaaay more productive but Weka stopped me for about 3 hours with no solution, anyway, I still have some days to be very productive. I'm a bit worried, about the research, today I didn't have any motivation to do it, not at all, I don't know why, hopefully I will feel inspired tomorrow. LeetCoded, as promised, tomorrow will be the first thing to do instead before bed (when my energy is at lowest).

## Day 77, Mar 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read some extracts of articles related to graph databases in order to do the second phase of research-based learning, I choose that topic because I find it really interesting and I think it will be the standard in the future, like GraphQL will be a must learn in univerisites.
Did problems 1342, 509, 346 of LeetCode.

**Thoughts**: Not the most productive day, not happy at all but keeping the LeetCode streak is vital, I spect to finish 4 homeworks tomorrow and use the whole Thursday, Friday for research (and LeetCode).

## Day 78, Mar 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my 'essay' on graph databases for the research-based learning activity, it took me quite some more time than expected, but finished it anyway. Finished my fifth homework of intelligent systems, went up in kaggle from 6 to 1 (for now, obvi), and was really fun. Started my sixth homework and yep, did not finished the 4 I wanted.

**Thoughts**: Lost my streak on LeetCode, I'm feeling super tired, maybe tomorrow I will continue, maybe only finish my homeworks, I need to rest, although I'm not sick I don't have too much energy.

## Day 79, Mar 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my sixth homework of intelligent systems, improved just a little bit over last homework, still in first place (for now).

**Thoughts**: Wasn't on the mood really, I'm feeling so tired, may take a 'day off' just covering the bare minimum for this challenge, taking advantage that there is no workload for now and the closest not-finished homework deadline is Thursday 26 (besides research).

## Day 80, Mar 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took my day off, only watched some YouTube videos about software trends of 2020, about web development, ML/AI, interviews, etc.

**Thoughts**: Recovered some energy, may take half day off tomorrow and I think I'll be fully replainished for classes and work.

## Day 81, Mar 21st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started new Udemy course, on Reinforcement Learning that promised to be out-of-the-box and not like the others, so I decided to give it a try, and so far I think it's a meh, for now, not my favorite, not the worst. Basically what I learnt was the explore-exploit applications and some methors like Bayesian/Thompson Sampling, Upper Confidence Bound and navie Epsilon-Greedy.

**Thoughts**: Pretty meh, some things are not explained at all or just vaguely explained, but other things are quitely good explained.

## Day 82, Mar 22nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish my research homework but failed horribly, basically did no progress at all, other than cleaning some unnecesary files and stablishing analogies, I really now what to do but I cannot do it, don't know why.

**Thoughts**: I failed, awfully.

## Day 83, Mar 23rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did mi intelligent system's exam, did pretty well, I studied a lot for it, I'm very proud of it. Postponed my research homework for Wednesday, I feel terrible about it, I think I'm failing me and my mentor.

**Thoughts**: I really want to be better at time management, no more distractions. I'm getting desperate.

## Day 84, Mar 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Nailed it, took me longer than expected but finished my progress on research, feels good. Did my advanced databases exam and I gotta way it was super easy, or maybe I studied a lot, but I finished it in 15 minutes and got a perfect score.

**Thoughts**: This semester will be high greades, fortunatly for my GPA, I expect +95/100.

## Day 85, Mar 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my compiler exam, I works completely and it's good, but, I need to separate reserved words and other stuff individually, they are, for now, mixed together, just for testing.

**Thoughts**: It was pretty fun, actually, enjoyed a lot doing it.

## Day 86, Mar 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my compilers exam, It was pretty fun, flex is really interesting, can't wait to start using yacc. Found bugs with my professor in my work of research, we hunted some but thre are some remaining, I'll address it tomorrow to keep going forward.

**Thoughts**: I don't know why I can't sleep well, and wake up feeling good the next day and be productive, I'm so tired of it.

## Day 87, Mar 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Hunted some bugs in Simod, still work to do, sigh, I just want to integrate the new SplitMiner and the Simulator from my colleagues. Continued my journey on OpenCV, with video basics, like connecting the camera or using video files, and drawing live on camera, this will be somewhat 'useless' for my project, because we will use simple images, but it was fun nonetheless.

**Thoughts**: This whole situation makes me nervous, I lose concentration really easy.

## Day 88, Mar 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went reckless and relentless with OpenCV, since I wasn't on the mood really for finishig correcting Simod, learned a lot, basically, all the basics of object detection, including template matching, 2 different approaches for corner detection, edge detection, grid detection, contour detection, feature matching and a super cool algorithm called watershed, and some introduction to face detection.

**Thoughts**: This OpenCV thing is really interesting, unfortunatly I can't think of a unique project to do by myself.

## Day 89, Mar 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Simod fully debugged and almos fully-automated for Scylla simulation execution. Phew, took a while, and some errors were insane, like, typos that broke everything, or missing tags that I totally missed to lookout.

**Thoughts**: Finally, I made it, I can rest peacefully at night.

## Day 90, Mar 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: More theory on compilers, on FIRST and FOLLOW functions useful for syntactic recognizers, very interesting theory, cannot wait to apply it to my interpreter with Bison. More theory on Intelligent Systems, on statistics for ML models, comparing 1 vs 1, 1 vs all and all vs all, very interesting topic, also, the professor gave us full insight about Covid-19 in our city, with predictions based on SEIR model with data from a lot of sources, pretty scary, but interesting aswell. Delivered my part to my professor on research, but again, another trouble, works son the GUI but not in CLI, neet to figure it out.

**Thoughts**: Mixed feelings with the Intelligent Systems class, not about the professor or the way he teaches, but the topic of covid, it all seems so unrealistic, like, dystopic.

## Day 91, Mar 31st 2020

**Today's Progress**: A lot learnt on Advanced Databases, on how to use MySQL with triggers, stored procedures, functions, events, varaiables, and other nice stuff, pretty fun class, have a lot to do from homework, brightside, we can use any language for backend and frontend, meaning, Angular + Node.js.

**Thoughts**: Getting mentally ready for 30-Day LeetCode Challenge.

## Day 92, Apr 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my database first homework, I made all the steps needed for a procedure but encapsulation (in the actual procedure) is needed, pretty fun tho. Started the LeetCode Challenge on 30 Days, done the problem 136 (challenge) and the follow up, 137. Struggled with my reseach 'task', I can perform it the 'easy' way but not in the 'right' way.

**Thoughts**: 1 problem a day looks easy, but consistency is key, for now it's pretty simple, but I bet the last days will take up several minutes on hard problems.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 93, Apr 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 202, it was 'tricky', but overall it was fun. Got more Compilers homework, that actually looks not fun at all, sadly. More theory on Intelligent Systems, with Bayesian Networks, looks cool, kinda similar to DecisionTrees, I'm excited to do the new homework. Back to my job, since the client took way too long to respond (since it's a hospital, with this pandemic sure they have a lot of work), some slight modifications where done to financial reports.

**Thoughts**: Consistency is key.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 94, Apr 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 53, it was familiar, I knew the best specific algorithm for the problem, the Kadane's Algorithm, so it was 'easy' for me to solve it, most of these problems are super easy to solve usigin a lot of time and a lot of memory, the real challenge is to use the fastest and the one with the lower memory consumption. Finished my database homework my procedure, it works as spected, I'm really happy about the result. Also, discussed with my team about the project, we have roles now and the milestones for it, it will be a nice project, I'll work on the backend and the frontend with Angular, Node, Postgres, and MongoDB.

**Thoughts**: It was a fun day, I'm looking for resources to have better results at kaggle on NLP on detecting spam emails, because I'm really unhappy with the results.

## Day 95, Apr 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 283, I think, overall it has good difficulty, it feels like we are upgrading, also did 1303 just because. More documentation and explanation on the databases project, also created the template on Angular and soon I will make the backend and integrate them both, should not take more than a couple of hours. Learnt about ApolloCache, read a lot and searched for infomation on how to implement it on Angular, for my surprise, I realized that had to be done on the backend...waste of hours

**Thoughts**: This LeetCode Challenge could build me up a habit, happy about it.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 96, Apr 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 122, quite interesting, not super hard not super easy, was somewhat familiar to me, and it has a lot of variats I would like to solve, because they range from easy to hard, also did 1350 to practice SQL. I missed CodeJam, I dunno why, I registered and set my calendar but I did not get notified and realized it was this day in the evening, so I watched some summaries solving the problems, they seem quite challenging, I know competitive programming is different than interview questions, but they look so different from regular LeetCode problems.

**Thoughts**: Recovering energy for the week, that is going to be super though.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 97, Apr 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 49, I was 'easy' in brute force but I was thinking all the posibilities to make it pure O(n) and didn't found a solution, turned out, it basically the fastest is O(nk)-ish more like O(nlogn) with O(n) in memory. Did my 7th homework in intelligent systems with very dissapointing results, Bayesian Networks performed super bad, I don't know if it failed for my features or the way I treated the missing values, but I was expecting better results, I might vectorize all and do SVM, but proooooobably not in Weka but only nltk and scikit learn, using my computer and not my laptop. Worked more with the database homework, since it was an unbalanced amount of work, I helped with a trigger and it was pretty fun. Worked with Angular, adding functionalities, now, the hospital can handle urgencies and improved medical services (more data).

**Thoughts**: Happy with my work with Angular, leart new form validation mechanics and another way to bind data other than ngmodel.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 98, Apr 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem actually unknown, I searched in the overall pool of problems and did not found it, followed the hints on LeetCode since I was not sure I fully understood the problem, at the end, after the hints I was right and was a successfull upload, also did problems 1351 and 1365. Also did my part of the database project, the first milestone, the backend of the login with Node and MongoDB, with crypted password and jwt, tomorrow will ad the frontend in Angular.

**Thoughts**: Took it 'easy' today, I was feeling really stressed but I'm good in my timings, everythig acording to the plan.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 99, Apr 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 876, linked list, find the middle value, pretty easy to be honest, solved the right way since it was 100% faster and 100% less memory on C++, also did 1085, 586 and 100. Did the frontend part of the login and register for the project, I really like Angular, it's just perfect for me. Also tried to work on my job, but the project is really big and got lost between files I thought I had to modify and in the end I could finish my task so I asked for help and guidance to my superior. Advanced a little bit on my article-like report on relational vs graph databases.

**Thoughts**: So close I can taste it, the 100th day.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 100, Apr 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 844, that was somewhat string manipulation but it can be done just by iterating and keeping some record on variables, did no more problem, I felt **really** bad today, had terrible headaches. Finished my task on my job, with guidance on where the files are was easier and more enjoyable. And yeah, 100 days...

**Thoughts**: Really proud of my self, time to step up and do #365DaysOfCode, and I actually have the perfect thing to step up the game. From now on, I will do at least 3 problems on LeetCode and I will do the Junior Training Sheet for competitive programming, with about 950 problems (didn't have enough with LeetCode right?), it estimated to last 750-900 hours to finish it, so it will be a nice challenge alongside my classes, my reseach, my job, my goals, my hobbies and personal study. Oh, and I will upload to GitHub every single problem solved, alongisde my datasheet that tracks my times on reading, thinking, coding, debuggin ans status about submissions. Next level will demand the most of myself, but I know with self discipline I can achieve anything.

## Day 101, Apr 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 155, a 'system design' on a stack that also tracks the minimum number, I was fun, also did another problem, 141, a [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/ "Official site") classic. Started the Junior Training sheet, did 3 problems, 677-D2-A, 634-D2-A and 112-D2-A, just to warmup and see how it works, I'm very excited about it.

**Thoughts**: I spent a few hours on home chores, and also talking and playing with my friend. Wasn't a very productive day, I neet to turbo up for the weekend to finish my research task and keep studying and practicing.

## Day 102, Apr 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 543, a tree problem, I was starting to miss trees and recursion, it was interesting, also did problems 1, 2 and 167. Continued the Junior Training sheet, did 5 problems, 228-D2-A, 231-D2-A, 236-D2-A, 263-D2-A and 265-D2-A, easy but clever, has some trouble with c++ stirngs, so, I learnt and that's what matters the most. Started my task on Simod, to try to make things work by usign all my previous work, not too much to report, tomorrow will be the heavy day.

**Thoughts**: The idea of the Junior Training Sheet is really cool, I just wish I had discovered it way long ago, but, it's never too late and I'm pretty sure I will smash my interview this year on Microsoft.

## Day 103, Apr 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1046, a stings adhoc problem, solved it somewhat bruteforcing it, but the output time was really good. Continued the Junior Training sheet, did 4 problems, 381-D2-A, 344-D2-A, 281-D2-A and 268-D2-A, easy, one was a toupper(s[0]) and that was it. Failed to finish my task on research, the herited code is really confusing and somewhat impossible to debug.

**Thoughts**: Being consistent on LeetCode and CodeForces, happy about it.

## Day 104, Apr 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 525, array problem reminded me about the Kadane Algorithm, it was somewhat similar, to keep track of current state and use a map for memory, also did problems 1295 and 199. Continued the Junior Training sheet, did 3 problems, 427-D2-A, 431-D2-A, and 791-D2-A, super easy. Discussed with my professor about the research, once again, we are going to leave Simod alone and focus on our things, the code is messy and nos functional as spected, the are some hardcoded things that make it not easily upgradeable. More theory on Compilers, pretty interesting of how LR Compiles build trees based on a stack with contents with pointers. More theory on Intelligent Systems, on feature selection, to determine the best features and some algorithms for it, so, new homework to make, this is 8/10, we are reaching the final of the semester.

**Thoughts**: Really happy about my day, motivated and productive.

## Day 105, Apr 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, unknown problem, apparently not released yet, about string rotation, it was very interesting, also did problem 21, another CtCI classic. Took my advanced databases class and it was quite boring, I pretty much did a recap on postgresql. The computer vision project was kinda messy, I clened the code a little bit. I rewatched 3+ hours of compilers classes and started my homework on build a syntax parser based on a LL(1) grammar.

**Thoughts**: Took a little break on competitive programming, but still constant on LeetCode.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 106, Apr 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, 238, product of array except itself without division, did a "two pointer" approach, not very efficient but good output on time. Worked the whole day on the compilers homework, struggled a lot, did 2 wrong approaches, but the third was right but I'm having some troubles unfortunately. Failed to finish my task on research, failed hard.

**Thoughts**: LeetCode constant, but getting fatigued on the rest.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 107, Apr 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, 678, about valid parenthesis but with a little plot twist, very interesting, the little tweak added the right amount of difficulty to be yet enjoyable. Solved my compilers homework doubt, I do not know what was I thinking, maybe sleep depravation or something is making me to think wrong and my logic thought wants some vacation. The Intelligent Systems' class was not quite good, I leart a lot about the aplications of computer vision, but not computer vision per se, didn't bothered me cause I learnt in another course the principles, but if not, I may be mad.

**Thoughts**: LeetCode constant, need to get back in track with the Junior Training Sheet and my courses on C++, GraphQL and AI, I just, don't find the time, and for the record, I've been very productive lately.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 108, Apr 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, 200, a DFS/BFS problem, did it DFS with recursion, I did this problem on my preparation for my Microsoft Interview, I really like this problem. Did my databases homework part on creating roles, tables and values for it, organizing the deliverables and everithing for monday.

**Thoughts**: LeetCode constant, still in the game, but it was my cake day so I took it easy.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 109, Apr 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, 64, the minimum path sum, got the brute force solution, but it was horrible, so I read the article on the best approaches and got it on DP with constant space (but not so great time). Solved my compilers homework, kinda, the grammar is correct and the recursive functions are correct (lexical analysis) because I tested them by hand, but for any weird reason my yylex() function crashes at some point on whitespaces or \n, so I asked for help.

**Thoughts**: I feel good it's (almost) done the homework, lesson learnt, not to leave the assignment for later, alligater.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 110, Apr 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, 33, search in rotated array, heard of this problem before and solved it with a friend about, 7 months ago, but didn't remembered the full solution. Finished my homework of compilers, after many days of struggle, need to clean it before uploading it to GH.

**Thoughts**: What a relief to finish the homework, so happy, the stress will go away finally. Not happy with the amount of problems I'm doing but at least I'm keeping it constant, need to improve.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 111, Apr 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, 1008, build a tree given the preorder, sounded familiar, somewhat, but it was fun, recursion with trees is my favorite approach (I searched the optimal solution and turned out to be iterative with a deque, smh). Did my compilers simple practice on bison, yes, no more LL(1) languages, now it will be LR bottom-up for the project. Learnt about one-class classification in my Intelligen Systems class, it was amazing, I've never heard about it before, my professor makes my classes so awe inspiring.

**Thoughts**: Had plenty of time, but had to help my girlfriend with his homework, so, no more LeetCode nor JTS for today, sadly.

## Day 112, Apr 21st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, an interactive problem of a matriz, pretty interesting, the first time I solve an interactive problem, kudos on LeetCode. Learnt more about Postgres and go my final project assignment, it will be the online grader I'm working on.

**Thoughts**: Stamina low, LeetCode constant, need a break.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 113, Apr 22nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 560, subarray sum, solved it like O(n2), since it was on the lower 10th on time but 100% on space, really bad tradeoff I presume. Adavanced with my opinion article on graph databases. Finished my task the best I could on research, hope my professor likes it.

**Thoughts**: I definetly need a break, I'm feeling really tired, hope the weekend can take a day off (except for my obligatory hour of this challenge), because I need to increment the amount of LeetCode problems, get back to the Junior Training Sheet, finish my plenty of courses, specially C++ and AI... Wow, the more I think about the pending things, the worse I feel, I'm not comfortable with my situation.

## Day 114, Apr 23rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 201, got it right-ish, the thing is I got TLE, the brute force solution is not accepted and bitwise problems are not my thing, so I looked up on LeetCode's official articles and got the answer correctly, definetly was not on my mind to do it that way. More compilers theory, on the symbol table for compilers, grosso modo, variables scope on the program. More theory on intelligent systems aboout genetic algorithms, needless to say it is an amazing topic, I was amazed the whole class, I liked it a lot, and I'm super excited to see Reinforcement Learning next class, no doubt I will learn more than I previously did. Onto reseatch, on the right path, now I have another task, we are gaining useful insights on the topic, but, I'm not sure we will be able to finish an article this semester.

**Thoughts**: Busy days like this makes me feel good.

## Day 115, Apr 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 146, LRU Cache from scratch on C++, applied the learnt things on constructors and destructors, the use of unordered_map over regular map and the power of iterators. Finished my essay/opinion article/whatever on databases, that was kinda boring to do. And finished my 8th homework of intelligent systems, about principal component analysis, got horrible results, I don't like how weka works on the results like this, will do a word2vec or something like that for the project.

**Thoughts**: Happy about the homework done and being constant on LeetCode, morale++.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 116, Apr 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 155, a DP or greedy type, the jump game, few years ago did a similar problem, but it was on a stair and it was very similar, I prefer the greedy approach, although the DP is more intuitive. Did my databases homework for the team, It was easy, just run a PDO crud with postgres, the challenging part was to know what was failing with the apache service and the postgres default user and password on Ubuntu.

**Thoughts**: Finally took my 'day off', on easy work and getting my mind back to ease, I'll take also tomorrow only doing the urgent pending stuff, and try to take a break to reduce stress and retake my productive days where more than 1 LeetCode problem was done, was doing JTS, and also studying C++, GQL, AI or whatever.

## Day 117, Apr 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1143, another DP problem, on substrings, i got the brute force 'no problem' but it was super expensive in time, so, with the LeetCode hints, got de DP version. Watched some TypeScript videos to refresh my memory on Udemy. Finished my task on Reasearch, almost almost, the calendar discovery is completed post grouping, however, the scylla .xes file does not work with the log reader... so, big problem here.

**Thoughts**: Feeling better, let's make our week super productive.

## Day 118, Apr 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 221, find a square of 1s inside a matrix, did a brute force aproach, like a sliding window applying a filter to an image, but the window changes size, didn't manage to get the DP version. New compilers homework, to create the symbol table, using flex and bison, will do probably a linked list with union types as value, and a char array as the name of the type, I already made the tokenizer and the grammar, tomorrow will apply the maths and on wednesday will start the symbol table. More theory on Intelligent Systems, Reinforcement Learning, to take a step deeper on applications on what I know, no math approach. Also did my ninth homework, trying new algorithms with Weka, was very dissapointing, used SMOTE+Discretize(filter)+JRip, weka results were pretty good, but Kaggle results were pretty bad, basically a random would perform the same, then I tried Multilayer Perceptron, awesome GUI, but at the end, Kaggle results were meh, no better results at all.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good, productive, finishing tasks early on, LeetCode constant, let's keep up the pace.

## Day 119, Apr 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, a 'system design' problem, on a stack with the first unique character, solved it witha regular queue and an unordered_map, tricky but not impossible, also solved 485 and 977. More homework on compilers, giving functionality on bison, tomorrow will implement the linked list and the symbol table. Learnt by myself about Mongo, more like a refresher because I previously worked with it, for my Database course quiz (next tuesday).

**Thoughts**: More LeetCoding (a lot more fun that JTS, not gonna lie) and doing homework early on, to keep myself out of stress as much as possible.

## Day 120, Apr 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 124, my first hard problem on this journey and it wasn't that hard, I found way harder de DP problems than this. Implemented the linked list struct and functions to insert, modify and read, alongside with error handling, looking good so far. Started my overview on Intelligent Systems for my exam.

**Thoughts**: The week started great, but accumulated tiredness does not fade just yet, took some time off, probably will to on friday.

## Day 121, Apr 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem unknown, but it was to verify if a string satisfies a tree path from root to leaf, was not hard at all, DP problems were, definetly, will do May Challenge too. Continued my overview of Intelligent Systems, just Reinforcement Learning and the topic of today, data visualization is left. Corrected the compilers homework, now I know I have to reduce the function size and separe it on smaller functions according to the bison process. Started to testing the Junior Training Sheet program, by doing a speedrun, was pretty fun actually, but it will force myself to finish another pretty long task.

**Thoughts**: I know, more things to do. No, I'm not crazy. Yes, I will finish every single project I started, trust me. Yes, the C++, ML, GQL, JTS and everything, I now I can and I will prove myself I can.

## Day 122, May 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 278, about binary search trees, got in the mood so I did another 4 problems on binary trees, problems 374, 938, 700 and 270. Added a little bit to my compilers homework, making it correct on empty words. Started my coursera course on Graph Algoritms, learnt even more about BSF and DFS and algorithms derived that can improve solutions.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling great, learning and being better everyday.

## Day 123, May 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 771, quite easy, solved it before the best way I could think of so I decided to do the brute-force-ish way, bad time good memory, Accepted, warming up for harder problems. Started my overview o distributed databases, since the class was just 10 min of a super overview, so I did my own overview, by learing by myself, quiz is on Tuesday and NoSQL is already reviewed, so I have less things to study for.

**Thoughts**: My 'day-off' to replenish energy.

## Day 124, May 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 353, about maps, solved quite easily, it was basically the same approach as the last one, jewels and stones. Finished the chapter on blind search algorithms in graphs, passed the test, now, a notebook (Jupyter) must be completed and evaluated to finish the tasks and move on the next chapter, will upload to GH giving all credits to coursera and the professor, just will expose my solutions. Finished my research task, was not hard at all, some configuration modifications. Added de type comparison con the compilres homework, really tricky since C does not provide a natural way to do it.

**Thoughts**: Enery recovered, LeetCode constant, feeling good.

## Day 125, May 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 476, bitwise, my worst category, didn't manage to get the result, only with LeetCode's hint and searching online, so the honest thing to do was not to submit it to the challenge, as actually did not manage to get the result by myself. More theory on compilers, honestly, was not very interesting but is useful for the project. Rearch task was good, my professor liked it, now a new task, to go further in a similar way but other approach. Studied the decentralized databases on a video, because the powerpoint was boring and was not very explicative. Started my research task, building a data structure for calendar discovery and some log data filling, but the output does not convince me at all, dunno why, look irrealistic.

**Thoughts**: Super day, feeling great.

## Day 126, May 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 378, another problem easily solved with a map, also did 744. Did my pre-partial quiz-like exam on Databases, based only on MongoDB, went well with 90%. Did my part of the last Databases homework, designing the structure of the data for a MongoDB database, was fun to do.

**Thoughts**: Super day, feeling great.

## Day 127, May 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 169, another map problem, but at first glance probably the solulion looks like a sorting problem, and can be done that way, I will increse from O(n) to O(nlogn) in time but decrease from O(n) to O(1) in space, so I think both are optimal solutions, depending on the tradeoff. Also did problems 1431 and 35. Finished my Intelligent Systems review for my partial exam (tomorrow). Started my task on research but I got complicated, I dunno why, variables where modified without me explicitly changing any value, super weird.

**Thoughts**: May I'm exaggerating, but I don't remember feeling this fatigue, woke up about 1:30 pm, I feel devastated, some days I have 'plenty' of energy, others, I feel I can't do anything.

## Day 128, May 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 993, kinda weird, about cousins in trees, definetly not an 'easy' warming up problem, it was easy for be becuase I've solved tree problems recently, if not, probably would be harder. Did my Intelligent Systems exam, took me about 3 hours, not super hard, just tricky and really interesting, I'm aiming for a 105 (extra points). Also spent a lot of time with other exam not programming related (Intelectual property). Tried to finish my task but python is doing really weird things, I don't know what is happening.

**Thoughts**: Feeling better, just the compilers homework for monday is pending (urgently), still constant in LeetCode, reorganized my learning path for C++, React, Angular, GQL, RL, Ethereum, Node, Docker and the projects of JTS, LV0, Coursera and school, everything while looking for a job to pay for my gf's MS Degree.

## Day 129, May 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1232, with the help of the hints and the internet on the correlation formula, it was super easy, but needed the specific math backgroud in order to be solved properly. Back on track on learning outside classrome, on smart pointers on C++ and the basics operations on MongoDB Shell (I need to confess that I previously worked with MongoDB but only with mongoose, did no query on the console...), tried to finish my task on research but failed, got an exteded deadline for monday.

**Thoughts**: Really enjoyed my rest day, let's grind it tomorrow, I know, my 1st day on the challeng was with C++, it's been 4 months, but I will leave no project nor learning path incomplete this year.

## Day 130, May 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 369, kinda interesting I got to say, about binary search but was somewhat strange the problem, and it had integer overflow, so a long long variable must be used (or any equivalent in another language). Back to Udemy streak, baby steps are easier and are still steps vs no steps at all, error handling in C++ and the MongoDB Shell configuration and some insight no MongoDB Compass. Made some progress on the online grader, adapting the dashboard to the project, creating the form, tomorrow I will design the DB and possibly adding GQL.

**Thoughts**: I think I need a larger break, I wake up feeling awful, then it gets better, but after some work, I get bored super easily and actually feeling tired.

## Day 131, May 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 997, about some mapping and other stuff, the thing is I struggled because did not considerate a lot of things for the problem, it took me 3-4 submissions to get accepted and it was pityful, so I decided to not get the coins on the challenge. Did my compilers homework, it's almost finished but I don't know why it has a bug in a function, it literally traverses de linked list looking for a value, if found justt exists de function, otherwise, raises an error, but it only goes from the head to the next and marks as not found, and it's basically the same code as printing the list (which works well) so it's driving me crazy.

**Thoughts**: Almost done, but it's so frustrating it bugs out and I don't know why.

## Day 132, May 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 733, a DFS based algorithm, not hard at all, but it had a little tweak to consider on the solution that comes quickly. More compilers theory, on how functions work, not really much new for me honestly. On intelligent Systems the class was a little off-topic, it was about LaTeX, in order to properly deliver the final project. Finished the compilers homework and oh boy, It drived me nuts, little errors that took me literally hours to figure out, but it's done after all.

**Thoughts**: Feel so relieved, tomorrow my last exam and then, only projects and research, we are on _endgame_ right now.

## Day 133, May 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 540, that had a straight up solution using a map, but it asked to solve it in O(logn(n)) because it was a sorted array, the intuiton was not precisely easy, but the statement of the problem gives the key hint, since the was no known target, the binary search must be performed based on the parity of the sub arrays; an xor will do the job without extra memory but in O(n) time. Had my databases exam, was ok-ish, got 88/100, the wrong answers where the ones of the class that lasted 15 minutes. Started the design of the database on competitive programming contest site.

**Thoughts**: The sleep depravation really harms my productivity, feeling kinda useless, but still LeetCoding so I'm happy about it, the streak goes for 40 days .

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 134, May 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 402 with basically all of the help, I honestly couldn't reach any solution by my own, my only idea was the brute force that obviouosly will result in a TLE, so again no submission for the challege, gotta keep it real. Finished the design of the database for the programming contest webapp. Tried to finish my research task but I dunno what the hell is happening, none of the things I do work.

**Thoughts**: had a terrible night, felt asleep about 6 am and woke up so tired and feeling awful, really bad day.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 135, May 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 208, about implementing a trie (suffix tree), it was pretty fun, I used an auxiliary node for storing the boolean value if is a complete word and an array of 26 spaces (alphabet) initialized as NULL and pointing to to other nodes when a word is added. More 'theory' on compilers, basically the next part of the proyect, building the syntax tree with the instructions, looks it will be fun and only fun. The Intelligent systems course finished with a bang, with "the group(only me and 3 actively participating)" giving ideas on using what we've learnt to apply to real world problems. Sad it ended, happy it happened. Finished the sql file on creating the database for the online grader, looking good, had a meeting with my team and decided the approach to use php, js and python as backends, the majority will be handled with js, the docker part with php and python for microservices for csv files, I have my tasks for tomorrow since we have to show something on Tuesday. Started my BairesDev application process, solving some non-coding related exams such as logic and behavior and some coding related like algorithms JS, MySQL, I think I'll finish them in about 3 more hours. Tomorrow will do de Oracle challenge for the new grad / last semesters position.

**Thoughts**: I love days like this, feeling good, did exercise, LeetCoded, an overall productive day.

## Day 136, May 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 918, an upgraded version of the Kadane's algorithm problem, with a circular array, solved with help, I neet to practice more and review some algorithms to perform better, I probably will be getting interviewed by Oracle and I need to ace it. Had my meeting with my professor of the databases course, to clarify some aspects of the project. Complement the design of the Database and started to do some UI.

**Thoughts**: My rest day, recovered and full of energy for tomorrow.

## Day 137, May 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 328, on linked list, to "sort" it in the odd-even sequence, was fun. Had a large talk with my team of databases and we decided to change the backend approach and split wisely the tasks, I was doing something in python like a microservice but it was discarded, also the auth part I did with node, not mad, It's for better, we also modeled the whole databases interaction (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Since we will be using laravel, took a recap on Udemy on Laravel content.

**Thoughts**: Tough and emotional day, tomorrow will give +1000% to achieve productivity.

## Day 138, May 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 438 on hashing strings and watch out for permutation, it was really interesting, all the problems with string permutations are hard for me, I can somewhat easily get the brute force solution but rarely get an optimized version. Did my Oracle Talent Challenge to get an opportunity for an internship, went ok, not the best but ok-ish. Finished my last homework of Intelligent Systems, was abount gaining insights on a paper and make discoveries on methods, questions answered, conclusions and implications. Did the presentation for databases for Tuesday, so tomorrow will be full coding the online grader project alonside research and probably the compilers next step.

**Thoughts**: Was aiming for better productivity but it was ok, the las homework took a while, and it was for Thursday so it was somewhat urgent.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 139, May 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 567, it was tough, I solved it the brute force way and optmized with a hash table but still got TLE, so I checked up the solution and the result was a sliding withdow with a vector, was close enough to the solution, not even sorting (O(nlogn)) surpassed TLE. More theory con compilers, the class was ok, and a new homework/part of the project was assigned, will work on it tomorrow. Had my meeting with my databases team, we split chores for what we are delivering tomorrow, I'll do the UX part on Adobe XD, did some screens and navigation, will continue on it tomorrow until the presentation. Started reading a book, the Data Structure Practice for Collegiate Programming Contests and Education, this for the paused JTS and LV0, so I improve on it while I do it on the summer for interview/coding training alongside with LeetCode, started with the Section 1 - Fundamental Programming Skills, so far nothing new, but I don't want to skip anything, I'd rather go super fast with it and use 2-3 weeks than skipping some skills I may be missing.

**Thoughts**:Great day, feeling good.

## Day 140, May 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 401, interesting I gotta say, not the most fun of system design but still pretty good. Finished a good portion of the Adobe XD prototype for the navigation of the online grader and got a 100/100 on the assigment, had a little meeting with me teammate for deciding our approach for the 5th homework of the compilers course and started the design of the new data structure for the syntax tree.

**Thoughts**: I really miss the intelligent systems class.

## Day 141, May 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 230, a binary search tree with a tweak, basically a inorder with a modification, interesting. Continued on the compilers homework, I'm not quite sure wich direction I should take, but I think at least, the things I've done are correct. Had my exploratory call with Lyft, for a front end engineer position, got really excited, the whole project looks very interesting, if everything goes well I might choose between Oracle and Lyft.

**Thoughts**: Had a terrible headache the most part of the day, so it was honestly a bad day, don't feel proud on how much I did but I definetely did my best.

## Day 142, May 21th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1277, ah yes, the dynamic programming part, the thoughest one for me, but managed to get the logic and somewhat the optimal solution fairly easy. Classes were super meh, and practically all the courses are finished. Did some progress on compilers homework, I'm not quite sure how to do it properly, it's very peculiar.

**Thoughts**: Had a large nap that truncated what a productive day should be, sad about it.

## Day 143, May 22th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 451, solved it with a map, but the best answer, as far as I understood was a heap or priority queue, need to practice those, specially their usability. Some compilers progress, the thing is, since the structure is built backwards, I might need to create a stack library, I have my doubts if it's the best approach.

**Thoughts**: My mentally relief day, some rest, napping, meditation and everything for the weekend.

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 486, about interesetctions in 2 interval list, really interesting, not particualar a data structure or algorithm question, rather a logic and applied, really interesting. Continued my Baires Dev job application process, since two recruiters contacted me and insisted they were really interested in me. More Frontend for the Online Grader.

**Thoughts**: My mentally relief day, some rest, napping, meditation and everything for the weekend.

## Day 145, May 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem about building a BST given de preorder of it, it was solved last month in the challenge, but it was goot to remember, I think it would be a nice problem for an interview, it contains the data structure fundamental part on the preorder sequence and programming tweaks. Finished my Baires Dev job application process, completed the last mandatory exams and some other to better asses my application. Added a stack for the compilers homework on a super easy way, hope it makes it easier. Did my research task on fixing the grouped counting activities, I hope as well it works properly, since I don't know the final output I cannot tell if I did right or wrong.

**Thoughts**: Productive day, started the week in a good way.

## Day 146, May 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1035, dynamic programming, about not crossing lines while pairing two arrays with lines, it was actually though, but somewhat manageable, got the intuition right and got help for the code, as soon as the semester ends, I'll be LeetCoding many hours a day, with competitive programming and learning a lot. Got a meeting with my databases team, we are in trouble, I don't think we'll manage to get it done for Jun 2nd, but let's try it with our best intentions. Wasted a freaking lot of time with useless assignments from other courses, this is one the only reason the research modality is not a 10/10. Added some code to the compilers homework, about 'binary' expressions consisting in left TERMINAL right, I think it's going well.

**Thoughts**: Productive-ish day, I really really hate wasting time doing non-coding related homework.

## Day 147, May 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved (yes, again) LeetCode daily challenge, problem 525, about contiguous array with equal amount of binary digits, a interesting map approach. Had a meeting with my professor for research, we are going forward, I need to correct things, but it should be fairly doable, and start thinging how to process batches of a file, for now, at half mb everything fits in the RAM, but we are expecting files of several GB to apply this research, so an a priori algorithm needs to be designed alongside with batching on data. Had a really long class about indexes in databases, really interesting topic on real uses of hashmaps and b-trees. Did a lot for the online grader, a lot of views and navigation, more to be done, but it was a really good progress, with this, I think we will finish a minute before submission deadline.

**Thoughts**: Super productive day, so motivated.

## Day 148, May 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved (yes, again) LeetCode daily challenge, problem 886, a dfs algorithm to find if a graph can be partitioned in two gruops, given who dislikes who (cannot be in same group), it was actually though, not even the brute force is straight forward as it may seem. Full day of databases, routing, views, some functionality. Gained some insights on the compilers homework, talked with my team for about 3 hours total to reamin in the same page on the approach, probably not finishing tomorrow, on June 5th once I finished the rest of my courses will be my top priority to deliver the assignment.

**Thoughts**: Need a break.

## Day 149, May 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 338, about counting bits, that honestly did not manage to solve it, not in brute force even, as stated before, I need to study that part a lot. Did the evaluator for compilers on operands and expressions, only loops are remaining (trickiest part).

**Thoughts**: I'm motivated to end the semester with good grades and honestly, I might fail this challenge because June 15th I won't get out of bed.

## Day 150, May 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 207, topological sort, really interesting, basically a pure topological sort plus finding cycles, if cycle incorrect, otherwise correct, got help with the code. So I just did the whole functionality of the compiler, everything is in functions to execute statements of all kind, data modifieres, conditionals and looping, maybe just need a refactor and somethings a renaming so everything fits well, as well as ordering the functions alphabetically, need help from my colleague for actually calling the functions, but besides that, hopefully it's done.

**Thoughts**: My "rest" day where I worked a lot, but definetly feeling so much better, despite the fact it was a very emotional day.

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 973, a priority queue, my approach and intuition, but got some help with the code on evaluation and implementation, but my thought processs was correct nevertheless. Finished the compilers homework, tomorrow will do some bug hunting and code cleaning. Continued the journy on the online grader, doing documentation, views and starting to do the event scheduler for announcements on the platform, going good.

**Thoughts**: Hard to focus, I'm not quite productive and feeling more tired everyday, but I'm keeping mentally string (somewhat).

## Day 152, May 31st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 72, a hard dynamic programming prblem, was suuuuper though, honestly could not get the solution, and the brute force approach might fail, next month challenge will be all by me, by June 4th I'll be only with 1 exam and 1 project, so i'll be full timing on LeetCode and learning and learning and an active jobsearch for my last semester, before jumping to the big leagues. No bugs found on compilers, so just I commented some print statements and uploaded it. Finished my task on research, I think, I'm honestly lost on this one, not sure why it works or why it doesn't work. Tried to do my task on the online grader project but failed miserably, I cannot focus.

**Thoughts** : We are close, I can taste it.

## Day 153, Jun 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 226, super easy, took me like 2 or less minutes since I'm familiar with it, about flipping a binary tree, as stated before, I will solve the whole June challenge by myself and be LeetCoding more every single day. Finished the databases project, and we are demoing tomorrow, happy about it and excited to make it even bigger. Final project assigned on compilers, basically add functions to the language, sounds tricky, so most likely it will definetly will be. Finally finished the most horrible course I've ever had, it was a knightmare, but it's done, one less to go.

**Thoughts** : I've been running low on research and studying but definetly Wednesday, after a little non-intensive day tomorrow will finish my Intelligent System's project and just 2 (easy) exams and the compilers project to go.

## Day 154, Jun 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 237, about deleting a node in a linked list, I think it's the most disliked questiong in LeetCode, simply because you receive the node you want to delete, not the whole list and the value you want to delete, easy nonetheless. Did the project demo for databases, got a 99/100, we missed a composite data type (part of requierements), we totally forgot about that, but the project is pretty solid and I'll be working on it on the summer. Started my intelligent systems project, it's a CS paper format about what we did in the course, basically, so it will be comparing behavior on algorithms depending on features and class imbalance, not comparing at all between algorithms (Friedman Test) because I only have 1 relatively small database. Continued my DS book, chapters 1.4, 2, 2.1 and 2.2, about dichotomy (binary search) and simulation processes.

**Thoughts** : Feeling motivated and good, I really need a break, I feel so so so tired.

## Day 155, Jun 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1029, a greedy algorithm, marked as easy but oh boy it may seem super easy at first but a speciall sorting or a priority queue needs to be used, very interesting way to put a problem that looks so easy in a tricky way. Talked with my professor about my presentation for tomorrow, pretty excited about it, show my contributions. Updated my CV for application marathon next week with the online grader and the research.

**Thoughts** : My wholesome day, mentally recovered.

## Day 156, Jun 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 334, in about 3 seconds, reverse a string so I used the stl, maybe it's cheating but I think I should use every tool I know. Did my presentation of my research and it went good, felt nervous for a little, but it was good. Did my Intelligent Systems exam, pretty fun and actually very easy.

**Thoughts** : One less thing to finish, yay!.

## Day 157, Jun 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 528, it was suuuuuuper weird, I didn't even undertood the question, it failed to deliver a good explanation by the problem, this, in a real interview scenario it's ok, because the point of interviews is to ask questions to clarify and fully understand the problem and constraints, but on LeetCode you cannot ask... that's way the question has so many dislikes, although the question is not hard per se, understanding it is quite tough. More on the Intelligent Systems project, I was so distracted, did not much at all.

**Thoughts** : I have problems with focusing, I need to concentrate on the work to finish it quick and then take my break.

## Day 158, Jun 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 406, special sorting, and easy peasy. Did a lot for the intelligent systems problem, basically ran 18 algorithms and made comparisons, wrote a lot for the report/paper, really interesting.

**Thoughts** : Almost one left (compilers) to go.

## Day 159, Jun 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 518, dynamic programming of coin change, of every possible combination, not the least amount of coins as usually is, kinda like a greedy and try every possible path in a tree, fun to do, not super hard, even tho dp is not my strenght. Finished my Intelligent Systems project, writing is not my passion, but all experimenting was super fun to do, motivated to learn-a-lot on summer about Machine Learning, and will try to apply Reinforcement Learning on videogames.

**Thoughts** : Compilers to go, LeetCode contant, today was 5 years with my girlfriend, couldn't be more happy right now.

## Day 160, Jun 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 231, bitwise! but I new exactly what to do but not how to, so I needed help to do the thing that I was thinking, felt good that got the intuition on bruteforce and super optimized in bitwise super quickly. Started the compilers final homework (add funtions to the language) and modified the token handler and the syntax, still thinking the best approach to build functions as treenodes to avoid another node type and exploit the capabilities of treenodes of having a symbol table.

**Thoughts** : I... don't feel motivated... at all.

## Day 161, Jun 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 392, a two pointers problem, to find a "substring" in a string, was super intuitive and my approach was O(n) in time and O(1) in space, other proposed solutions on the problem involved maps and other stuff that actually complicated the problem and added memory to it. Reorganized my learning path, to achive more, I have a better plan now, looking in retrospective this year, set a more "realistic" goal but I know I can push harder and stretch as much as possible without tearing my life appart because of no deadlines.

**Thoughts** : I feel I'm procrastinating to another level, I feel bad about it.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 162, Jun 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 35, a binary search problem that was really easy, it's basically a regular binary search application. More C++, before the best part (stl), about streams and files, really interesting, it should be fun to try to implement every single thing of all I've learnt, maybe a hello word of WebAssembly should be really fun. Read the whole 3rd chapter of my Algorithms book, on greedy algorithms, like Kruskal, Prim, Dijkstra, and many others, they are quite complex, not taught in a regular algorithms course, I need to code them, probably will make a dynamic library on c++ on these algorithms, if the stl does include them, we'll see.

**Thoughts** : I feel I'm procrastinating to another level, I feel bad about it.

## Day 163, Jun 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 95, a two pointer/sort approach, that my first thought was a count sort, but then I re-read the problem and it stated that only 3 different numbers can be in the container, always 0,1 and 2, so if statements are enough to solve the problem efficiently. Tried to debug the compilers homework, spent hours and hours and got the conclusion that the tree wasn't build correctly, part of my fault for not noticing it earlier.

**Thoughts** : I feel so bad, like really really bad, the only thing that relieves me is that this is almost over.

## Day 164, Jun 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 380, a system disign-ish question, but it was basically to "merge" a map and a vector, really interesting, also did 1266, a geometry problem, just for fun, I'm seriously excited about making a c++ library for algorithms unavailable in the stl. Did the final exam on databases, got final grade of 93, and Intelligent Systems ended with 100, so only compilers is left. Indeed the syntax tree was wrong, so my colleague fixed it and I'm reworking on my code to make it work with the new tree structuere.

**Thoughts** : Feeling better, lately I'm feeling like a rollercoaster.

## Day 165, Jun 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 368, a mixture of math and dp, was really tough for me, got somewhat the approach and got help for the code, not sure if I'm getting worse or the lack of proper sleep and other healthy habits are dragging me down. Finished the compilers part, on fixing the execute of the code, it now works perfect.

**Thoughts** : Now, add functions to the compiler... _sigh_.

## Day 166, Jun 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 787, Dijkstra! got the intuition right away, and yes, was the first solution recommended by LeetCode so I was happy, got help with the code, since I'm not thinking that straight. Did some pseudocode and discussed with my colleague the solution for a problem we had, implemented the functions to execute functions (I know it sounds weird), but, the code broke, and I had no idea why, he told me it was done, the functions stack was working properly and the declarations of variables (symbol's table) for each function was working well, but on the last push, it broke up, now it doesn't find the variables, not even the global ones, I think it's the only part missing, because from 1 intstruction to another, another function to verify the ID is changed and it breaks, but it makes no real sense.

**Thoughts** : So close and yet so far.

## Day 167, Jun 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 700, find insertion in BST, since I had a lot to do on compilers didn't bother to think another approach I've preoviously done. I spent the whole day woking on compilers, about executing functions, the returning values, I didn't have enough time to implement recursion, sadly, but overall, there were many hours of work on it and feels good to finish the semester.

**Thoughts** : Ok, now, to recover from stress, I'll take a "light" week to replenish my energy and boom, my productivity will spark.

## Day 168, Jun 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 468, about strings, it could be greedy, dive and conquer, regex, and probably other approaches, since I've never done before regex with C++ I tried that approach, it was kinda weird, C++ regex are very different from JS ones, so it was, weird (for the lack of a better word), and finally got help, since most of online forums are about JS regex. Had my exploratory call with Google, very happy the consider me for a full time role, my application will start on mid-August so I need to destroy my brain and fingers coding and getting better now.

**Thoughts** : Got a 85 on compiliers, not bad, my effort was worth, now I feel relieved, rested and motivated, I still need some rest, but I'm almost ready to rise a phoenix.

## Day 169, Jun 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 130, a DFS problem, it was really fun, a BFS approach was also valid but I opted for a DFS since the complexity are the same and a DFS always guarantees the answer. Reorganized my schedule to LeetCode and learn things to be a pro full stack, to fit with my workout schedule and leave room for proper rest. Read many small articles about web development.

**Thoughts** : Got a 97/100 on my semester so I'm really happy, 4 courses to go.

## Day 170, Jun 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 274, a sorting + binary search problem, it wasn't easy at all, the description was somewhat confusing, but nevertheless it was solvable. So back on track on learning, did a super full recap on Angular, in my talk with Chase (Google Exploratory Call) we agreed that my best path for now is to become a pro at full stack so I'll be a pro at full stack, will try to master Angular and Node, with very good knowledge of UI/UX, Cloud, Mobile and other stuff. So I did about 16 chapters on Angular, starting from scratch, yep, my whole day was pure Angular and I can only say that I really like it, way way way more than React.

**Thoughts** : I'm back at it, I know I can handle it.

## Day 171, Jun 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Ok so, I failed the LeetCode challenge, I looked at it, I was like, uhhmm what? I'll do it later, and that later become not today, I lost all internet conection due to a problem with the modem, so I only did 2 sections on Udemy on Angular, and took the day off, not that it was a must, but my body was screaming to rest, so I gave it a shot and did what my body told me. On the Angular part, looks like I've been doing forms wrong, or maybe not wrong, but not optimal and not in a Angular-esque way.

**Thoughts** : I'm back at it, I know I can handle it.

## Day 172, Jun 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 60, it was as tricky as is could be, it was a math problem, about permutations, did the intuition of backtracking right, but found that the glorious stl has a next_permutation function on strings, so a cast and several calls to the function made it (super slow) into Accepted. Did more Angular, now on http request on the Angular default module, it's very powerful, I'll use it instead of axios next time.

**Thoughts** : My wholesome day with my girlfriend, so not much to do, it's my mental + 100 day.

## Day 173, Jun 21st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 79, a DFS + DP problem, got the intuition right, really fast, but struggled at coding at some "edge cases", nevertheless, happy that my intuition was right and as efficient as I could think off. More on Angular, I'm almost done, learnt about somo aspects of authentication I didn't knew, dynamic components, the modules structures, hoy to deploy, Angular Universal (server side rendering), Angular Animations and the offline capabilities of Service Workers, only testing and NgRx to finish the course and we are done, onto the next one.

**Thoughts** : Productive day, happy about it.

## Day 174, Jun 22nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 134, solved like a hash problem but tried the bitwise solution, it's super elegant, I mean, not only it's O(n) in time and O(1) in space but the solution is as beautiful as it can be, seriously. No luck on enrolling for summer courses, apparently ther is a problem with the research course. More on Angular, almost done, only NgRx (partially) is left. I need to think my next big move, besides more LeetCode.

**Thoughts** : Felt bad, had a really bad sleep, and felt tired most of the day.

## Day 175, Jun 23rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 222, a binary search tree problem, basically a counting nodes one, the O(n) solution is super easy to do, and it applias to every binary tree, but the problem stated that it was a complete BST, so a little tweak can be done to improve performance. I wasn't on the mood to finish the NgRx module on Angular, so I hopped through a lot of post on programming tendencies, how to write better code, how to be a good team-based programmer,etc. Got good new, I'll probably work on 3 projects this semester, enough to pay tuition, debt and have a starting money when I graduate.

**Thoughts** : Not that I'm not motivated, _au contraire_, I'm pumped up, but today was simply not my day.

## Day 176, Jun 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 96, A dp + BST, quite though but not impossible, on finding the amount of unique BST given a input, I got most of the logic completed but at the end got help to solve it. Had a meeting with my teammates for freelance projects, looklike we are going to have fun on the weekends. Finally was able to enroll on my research course, this will be nice because it's 5 weeks of progress with research and discipline.

**Thoughts** : Despite being my wholesome day I'm not satisfied at all of what I did today.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 177, Jun 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 287, a problem that on first sight could be a sort then linear search or linear search with a hashmap, but the restrictions con the problem specified that this two specific approaches are not valid, so a two pointer-ish approximation must be implemented, like in a linked list with the fast and slow pointer, to find a cycle, applied to an array, really interesting, coming up with this idea IMO is quite rare. Finished Angular course, finished the NgRx module, and oh boy it's boring as boredom can be, I find very tedious the Redux architecture, and, I mean, React users have little to no choice, but Angular can manage many many things without it, it seems like an overkill in any small or medium-small webapp.

**Thoughts** : I was kinda tough to finish the NgRx part, I really really don't like it.

## Day 178, Jun 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 129, a DFS on tree problem, it was pretty interesting, the intuition can come up pretty quickly. So I spent a lot of time with a quotation for a possible clint, It will be my biggest project yet, a full retail store for multiple brands, blogging, user profiles and many more things.

**Thoughts** : This week was a mess, an absolute mess.

## Day 179, Jun 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 279, a dp problem, with some spicy math about perfect squares, it was tricky, but found the best approach is to calculate squares first and then use dp to find the result, it wasn't super hard, but by no means it was easy. So I finished the quotation for a possiblec client, everything points to a success on a negotiation, I really hope so, it will be my most ambitious project, big and hard, with social impact, so I really hope I can work with them.

**Thoughts** : This was the worst week of the year on productivity terms, some problems took about the hour of the challenge, and had to read articles just to fill the time, it's just, I don't know what is happening.

## Day 180, Jun 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Missed the LeetCode challenge, like, I forgot about it, since it's usually the first thing I do, and today I started with React... so, yeah, no challenge but React basics, since I'll (most likely) will be working with it in 2 projects with my colleagues.

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 62, a dp problem, kinda similar a one that I previously solved before, actually I thought it was a repeated one but no, it wasn't. Solved more problems as part of my training, numbers 359 a system design-ish with maps, 1021 on string manipulation and 1047 on string manipulation + stack. Not much else done, helped at home, trying to get my energy and my willing to do things back.

## Day 182, Jun 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to Solve the daily challenge, I got TLE on my solution after _several_ minutes of trying to get a succeed, so I searched for help and the answer was a Trie + backtracking, not a DFS, that's why I got a TLE. Not much more. I have something mentally that doesn't drive me for more, although I'm striving for success and landing a FANMAG (or WITCH) job I just can't, I'm burnt.

**Thoughts** : Back to "productivity" (yesteday's thought... ye, no). I have something mentally that doesn't drive me for more, although I'm striving for success and landing a FANMAG (or WITCH) job I just can't, I'm burnt physically, mentally and emotinally.

## Day 183, Jul 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 441, a math-ish greedy-ish problem, more like and ad-hoc one than an algorithm, at the end it had a binary search approach with some math, quite interesting. So... back to research! had a long meeting with my mentor about our next steps and playing with our info. Really excited to work with it during summer. I'm just waiting for a project to be confirmed, I'm getting desperate to work.

**Thoughts** : My wholesome day. Reorganized my schedule to work and do my workouts. Another virtually failed week, but it's something really mental.

## Day 184, Jul 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 107, a level order traversal for a tree, but reversed, basically a queue problem, quite easy but I'm pretty sure my answer can be improved. Did my research homework, the second iteration of our work, now in a new file to prevent larger and harder to read files, with data display to visualize the support for workdays.

**Thoughts** : I'm feeling better.

## Day 185, Jul 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 957, a super weird problem, basically a game of life-ish problem, but about prison cells that get occupied if on the left and on the right are the same state (occupied or empty) and gets emptied otherwise, the main part is to dectec cycles, there are a finite amount of different states, in this case 14, so no matter how many "iterations" should be performed, there are only 14 different states and thus it's time consuming to recalculate a previous state, like a dynamic programming approach. Showed my homework to my professor, he was happy, I was happy, it's starting great, so I started my homework today and finished the first part, about obtaining work ranges, the next part will be to do de same approach but usign a work schedule with intervals, like a lunch break.

**Thoughts** : Worked some hours, starting to regain my power, I just home my clients accepts the project and my summer will be as awesome as it could be.

## Day 186, Jul 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 264, a ugly number follow-up problem, actually, to retrive the n-th ugly number, so basically, it's generating a sequence and can be optimized with a 3-pointer-ish approach, since an ugly number is divisible by 2, 3 o 5.

## Day 187, Jul 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 461, a bitwise problem, to find the hamming distance, I remember this topic from my computer organization course, back in my 3rd semester, one of my favorite courses, but yeah, the bitwise problems are the thoughest for me, I had my brute force idea but it was really slow compared to any bitwise approach, so I decided lookup for possible solutions and it turned out C++ has a builtin function, and I just need to send an and operation between the two numbers, and it took 4 ms, ranking the worst time possible, so I'm glad I didn't upload my brute force, I probably would get a TLE. I tried to do my second homework, but the Scylla simulator is incapable of doing what we need, I don't know if my colleague's simulator is finished so we can use it now.

**Thoughts** : Feeling better.

## Day 188, Jul 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 66, similar to the naive addition of two linked list, but using constant space and O(n) in time, with a simple condition to exit to save time. Had my meeting with my professor, presenting my 2 successful homeworks, we discussed next steps, to partition in ranges of support with a greedy algorithm, fix the hour changing on october and on how to use the calculated support by representing it in a tree, but my idea is to use a DAG, weighted (the support), so a traversal with a minimum support, will lead to pruning the tree.

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 463, it was, really interesting, it reminded me about the number of islands problem, but it was to find the permiter of a single island, it was basically a counting solution, one by one, even empty spaces since the shape is unknown... it could be a U. Grinded Node.js course, since I'll be working (hopefully, fingers crossed) on a big proyect and I want to do the backend on Node with express.

**Thoughts** : Yup, finally upgrading my Node.js.

## Day 190, Jul 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 15, a follow up for the classic 2 Sum, the 3 sum, which basically is a O(n2), by sorting and pivoting one value, then do a regular 2 Sum but the goal is a+b+c=0, and since it's sorted, a two-pointer approach for the 2 Sum subproblems fits perfectly. No talk with my professor, I assume he was really busy. Asynchronous Node theory.

**Thoughts** : My wholesome day, and I gotta say I'm feeling great.

## Day 191, Jul 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 662, to calculate the width of a tree, but it felt like a ICPC problem where you have to use unsigned long long in order to not get an overflow for C++, languages like Python have less restrictions with these kind of problems. More Node.js, no official contract but I'm keeping my hopes up high.

**Thoughts** : Another wholesome day, quite unexpected, a familiar one.

## Day 192, Jul 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 430, to flatten a doubly linked list with a graph traversal, really interesting, I think it should be a classic problem on linked list, it's a very clever problem in my opinion. Had a meeting about a possible project, sounds good, but right now I need profit, and the company behind the project aren't willing to pay for it, so maybe, just maybe, we will do it for in our free time. More Node, such an awesome environment.

**Thoughts** : High hopes on the super big project but not anything else, no one appreciates work and wants to pay super low quantities for small-medium projects.

## Day 193, Jul 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 78, to generate a power set of a given array, so it was basically generating vectors and push them to the global vector solution, it was really interesting, to play with memory leaks and time consuming, since all the comnbinations are 2<sup>N</sup>. More on Node.js, about deployment.

**Thoughts** : A super wholesome day, the best day in the year.

## Day 194, Jul 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 190, a bitwise problem... yup, got stuck but somehow I got the answer, at the end I got help to accomplish it. More on React, about styling and debugging.

**Thoughts** : Another wholesome day for me and my mind, but somehow I'm statting to getting dissapointed, since no project is confirmed.

## Day 195, Jul 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 100, to find if a tree is equal to another, super easy since it was a BST. Started my homework on building the Graph to represent the calendar, using the library networkx for Python, I hope my professor likes it, specially since it can be plotted and easy to visualize. I'll be working on a project with a friend, an entrepreneurial-ish stuff.

**Thoughts** : Back to productivity.

## Day 196, Jul 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1344, angle checking on clocks, an ad-hoc problem, basically, felt like a CodeForces to be honest, but fun nonetheless. Completed my graph on research, it was really cool, the networkx library is super cool.

**Thoughts** : Research is looking great.

## Day 197, Jul 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 51, to reverse words in a string, this is an example -> example an is this. Really fun, a two pointer approach was enough to do the task. So I had my meeting and... no longer a graph, it should be changed to a dictionary to avoid using so much extra memory, either a self defined class or a library. So all my work was "in vain".

**Thoughts** : Two steps forward then three steps back on my research, not happy with changes like this.

## Day 198, Jul 16th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 50, to implement a pow function, I think it's kinda obvoius I got a TLE, since the solution is a math tweak. Finished the research dictionary and started the traversal. Consolidated the product I will create as an entrepreneur with a friend, really excited about it.

**Thoughts** : Morale ok-ish.

## Day 199, Jul 17th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 347, a priority queue problem, it was very easy to get the intuition for the data structure, however the code was not that easy since another data structure is needed, a pair. Very interesting problem, and I think it can be useful in reallity, unlike implementing my own power funcion... Another meeting, another change on research, now, not even a dict, a list of tuples that contain all ranges, now specific hour ranges are taken out, can't complain, it's easier to work with, I even got the 'pruning-traversal' of the hour ranges given a minimum support threshold.

**Thoughts** : I feel bad about my productivity, self-steem running all time low.

## Day 200, Jul 18th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 210, a topological sorting, on 'labeled courses' with prerequisites, the goal was to determine if is solvable (build the 'graph'). It took me a while, most of the hour of today, and since it's my rest day was enough for me.

**Thoughts** : Feeling better overall.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 201, Jul 19th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 67, add binary strings, oddly enough, it's easier for me than bitwise, start backwards and do an "add operation" bit by bit and have a carry, simple but traversing strings and adding to them it's way easier on JS and Python, but I choose C++ and I'll stick to it, I like it. Finished the XML creator, really happy about it, one step closer to start writing the paper. Finished the model of the DB of my entrepreneurial project and started the setup for the backend.

**Thoughts** : Happier.

## Day 202, Jul 20th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 203, a follow up of the classic remove a node from a linked list that matches a number, now, you need to remove all matching elements, so it can be 1 or more, simple yet it has a tweak if the element to remove is the head and subsequent nodes also need to be removed. A lot of interaction today, I was invited to join research on machine learning and I'll gladly be part of, the professor that invited me is the same as the one of my favorite course, intelligent systems. I wrote a recommendation for him on LinkedIn also. Had a meeting with my research professor, we fixed a little thing and he was happy with my results, now, we will polish our work and make comparisons with the belgium researchers on Resource Availability. Extracted the notebook code to simple python files, since they work properly and to reduce unnecesary printings and executions like the support dict and graph versions.

**Thoughts** : Feels good to get noticed by a great professor.

## Day 203, Jul 21th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 79, a word search on a matrix that single letters cannot be reused, used a DFS approach with a somewhat ok-ish time complexity, Read all the Niels Martin paper, on Resourse Availability Calendars, it was really interesting, I'm a little worried since theoretically it represents a higher precision, but the code is unclear and there is no README to verefy the results and compare them. Got contacted again in LinkedIn by recruiters, looks like economy is starting to get recovered.

**Thoughts**: Yeah, worried, the other research looks kinda more solid than ours.

## Day 204, Jul 22th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 103, a level zig zag traversal, I remebered that I did something exactly the same, but it was another problem, so it's kind of a duplicate because the one that I did previously was a follow up from a regular level order. Had a loooong meeting with my professor, we didn't managed to run the project of Niels Martin, so we are kinda stuck since in Europe they are in vacation, so our answer will arrive on August. Prepared my research homework analyzing the bimp xml file on the calendar and id management.

**Thoughts** : Dear developer, if you are reading this, write READMEs please ! specially if the code is going to be used by other people.

## Day 205, Jul 23th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Actually did not solved LeetCode daily challenge, I totally forgot about it, I don't know why... so my streak is over, and this is not the case I solved it in the problems section and forget to do it in the challenge section, no, no LeetCode today at all. On better results, finished my homework, but I have a bad feeling, I think I'm missing something because something does not feels right. Had an interview with CellFusion, a total failure, they needed an experienced Java developer in Spring and applets and things I've never done before, _sigh_ recruiters...

**Thoughts** : Not an awful day at all, at least I finished my homework.

## Day 206, Jul 24th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Actually did not solved LeetCode daily challenge again, yeah, it was a really bad day, had a meeting with my tutor and yeah, I did wrong my homework, well, I understood wrong my tasks, because I did exactly what I though it was right. So a bit of discussion, on using BIMP, advantages and disadvantages, but concluded to be worthy, since we cannot use our own (my colleague work) just yet.

**Thoughts** : 2 days of no LeetCode, what is wrong with me ?

## Day 207, Jul 25th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 154, search a minimum value in a rotated array, where duplicates exists, this is a follow up from the regular rotated array with duplicates added, it's not much different from a regular binary search. Stated to work on my homework but the log reader failed, I configured correctly in the BIMP interface but had problems while loading the file, I'll try it manually to see if it works.

**Thoughts** : Simod and BIMP always have problems...

## Day 208, Jul 26th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Actually did not solved LeetCode daily challenge again but this time was intentionally, I needed to rest, from everything on the internet, to rise like a phoenix tomorrow, had a terrible headache so I couldn't finish my homework, I'll postpone my meeting 2 days. Only read my book of Machine Learning, read the introduction of every chapter, Decision Trees, ANN, Bayesian, Computational learning, Instance-based, Genetic, Rule-based, Analytical, Inductive+Analytical, Reinforcement... Since I'll be working with my professor of intelligent systems, I need to get a little bit more on the global topics of ML.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow a fresh start.

## Day 209, Jul 27th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 160, to build the tree with inorder and postorder traversals, all the tree reconstruction is hard for me, I need to study it more. Also did 1528, a sort-string problem, fairly easy, to warm up for tomorrow to be a great LC day. I did as much as I could with my research homework, but the log reader failed, but for starters, the BIMP website does not work as spected, or at least not like we thought, if we try to create ranges we need to split the timetable, but using the same name is useless since the id were different and the one assigned to the resource is the first one, so manual work was done but as previously said, the log reader crashed, on the role discovery part. I was somewhat "referred" to a job position in Mexico City on Microsoft, so today was my formal application, so nervous. Fixed this journal, with the correct cardinality and added content.

**Thoughts** : Not precisely the _best_ return but it was a good one, on the upside, this leaves room only for improvement wich I will.

## Day 210, Jul 28th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode problem 299, a bulls and cows problem, basically to return the amount of bulls and the amount of cows given an input and the secret. Re-made the quotation for the Utopyan project, basically he told me that he wanted me to do it, just remove some stuff to make it more affordable and start as soon as possible, there is hope at the end of the darkness. Got proposed another project, basically a Rappi clone, not big pay but it should be "easy".

**Thoughts** : My last wholesome day as used to be, next ones I will work a lot more, more stuff on reaseach, back to classes and this project and I _NEED_ to study more on LC. Morale better.

## Day 211, Jul 29th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 304, actually got a little bit of help, because I didn't quite understood the problem as a whole, it was the follow-up number 4 of buy and sell stocks, but it lacked explanation and oh surprise, it's not a super realistic environment where I can ask questions, but at the end the solution was really really simple. Finished the quotation, I hope to get the job and start ASAP.

**Thoughts** : Yeah, new monthly challenge, August, and I will fix my life from one day to another, I will do my very best and push to the extreme limits.

## Day 212, Jul 30th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't solved LeetCode daily challenge, why? I forget to do it (yes, again). Managed to do a super schedule for my next semester, pushing 2 projects, with a 75:25 split on Utopyan and my personal entrepreneurial project, research, exercise, constant training, and even some reading. More on Node.js since I'll be working really soon on backend, testing and mailing.

**Thoughts** : Not a great day to be honest, feeling kinda sad and stressed.

## Day 213, Jul 31st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 70, a straight up DP problem, gave me fibonacci vibes on result is the same - 1 and same - 2 and do it recursively with of course a dynamic programming part to improve performance. Not much done besides it, a little improvement on my organization calendar. Also read some articles on current situation on programming industry, oh boi what a year to be a grad...

**Thoughts** : Feeling emotionally bad, my little dog is getting really sick.

## Day 214, Aug 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 520, really easy, basically to detect if capital letters are used correctly, so it's either 0, the first only or all the letters, so a counter and conditions made the trick with the right amount of time and space complexity, and also solved the premium exclusive 354, a logger with cooldown, it was actually solved before but it is a nice system design question. Made a list of all companies I will apply tomorrow and a list of LC problems I need to solve to achive my dreams.

**Thoughts** : Good comeback on LeetCode, I'll do about 15 hours a week, and it's quite a lot, considering I'll be doing 10 hours of excercise a week and 43 (aprox) hours of work a week (split 75:25 with Utopyan(big project) and Crowd (my entrepreneurial project)) and time with my girlfriend (future fiancee) and constant training _plus_ my research in university. It was supposed to be my wholesome day, but, my little dog is very very sick, so, actually was a very sad day, I cried several times.

## Day 215, Aug 2nd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 705, to design a hash set, yep, solved it, got an AC but did it wrong, my bad, didn't read the do not use a built in dictionary, so a good approach is a BST, with a O(log(n)) on find and insert in best cases, not even neet to check collisions or do buckets IMO. Also did problems, 953 to validate an alien dictionary, 680 to validate a palindrome by removen 0 or 1 letter, tried a stack approach, failed, did a two pointer, and got it right, 1239 to get the max length concatenating strings with unique characters, started with a wrong approach since I thought it could be only a pair of them, not multiple, got it right at the end using a greedy approach with sets.

**Thoughts** : More on LC. Today was a more wholesome-ish day, feeling better thanks to my girlfriend and her support, but still very sad and worried for my little dog.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 216, Aug 3rd 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 125, to validate a palindrome, so a two pointer approach solves it in O(n/2) which is O(n) and O(1) in memory, better than a stack approach, there is probably a super weird niche algorithm that solves this, but it's unrealistic in a coding interview. So, last semester enrolled, 3 and hald (and probably more like 3, cuz' the half of research I did in summer vacation) courses to go. I got confirmed on Utopyan, a really interesting e-commerce site, I'll put a part of my soul on it so I can get my payment and buy that engagement ring for my future fiancee :D, so I did a full Product Manager day, lifting requirements (also tomorrow will be and start doing the scrum cards and sprint plannings). I need to urgently learn about AWS for both Utopyan and Crowd, RDS, EC2, S3 and all the streaming products...

**Thoughts** : Yes! I got the project. No! a lot more to study... oh wait, that's incredible, I love to learn new things!

## Day 217, Aug 4th 2020

**Today's Progress**: _Didn't solved LeetCode daily challenge_, I missed the timing, I was doing other stuff, working as a PM, lifting requirements and then... the time expired for today's challenge, yeah, I lost by missing the timing. Just worked as a PM since it's my last wholesome day.

**Thoughts** : I'm an idiot sandwich.

## Day 218, Aug 5th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 211, to add and search a word, using a trie, maps and with the inclusion of a 'wildcard' which is the '.' that represents any letter, quite interesting, its a regular trie implementation with the adition of a wildcard on any given letter. Read a little bit about Divide and Conquer approaches.

**Thoughts** : I felt terrible the whole day.

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 219, Aug 6th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 442, find duplicates in an array, easy solved with a map, but a follow up was using a O(1) in memory, and that part was a killer for me. I spent a lot of time as a PM for a little side project just before starting with Crowd, since Crowd should be ready for November, a quick cash comes in handy, a rush of 2-3 weeks to deliver a 'betting' site, so I searched for templates for the frontend to save time and focus on backend and functionality.

**Thoughts** : Yes, just what I needed right now.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 220, Aug 7th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 314, it was really though to figure out straight away, but a map managed to track positions and also did the 987, which was the same but needed the vertical traverse to be sorted by 'column'. Really interesting problem, a top for Facebook, which btw, I'll receive a first interview around september, probably october.

**Thoughts** : Taking it easy right now, the calm before the storm.

**Link to Work / References** :

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Day 221, Aug 8th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 437, a path sum on a BST, that looks really easy at first glance but all the tracking part complicates it, fortunately the solution is the sum of all possible 'traversals' from a node to another node, no partitioning on two nodes. re-solved the problem to find the closest to target in a BST, literally a binary search, but in a tree.

**Thoughts** : My wholesome day, proper rest, ready for everything.

## Day 222, Aug 9th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 994, find if the oranges will rot given a time, spreading in a BFS way, so a BFS solution is the optimal way in my opinion, used a deque to traverse and modify the grid.

**Thoughts** : Cleaned my desks for working on everything, orgnized my week with extra stuff like Google's Developer Student Club which I may be part of in the future (but not for too long, as I'm graduating in December) and calls and meetings with people to get my job done properly.

## Day 223, Aug 10th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 171, to convert excel column to number, it was more a math-ish ad-hoc problem than a a DS+Alg problem, also did 168 which was the opposite of 171, problem 268 to find the misssing number in a range [0...n] with bit manipulation using XOR, problem 1480 to find the running sum, basically always add the acummulator of all previous cells in an array, problem 1512 to find "good pairs", which is n[i]==n[j] and at the same time i < j, problem 1527 to perform a MYSQL query solved it with REGEXP. Had a meeting for the small project of NFL Survivor like website, the seemed very very happy, tomorrow they will confirm the start of the project, also worked a little as PM lifting requirements and designing the database. More progress on the Utopyan DB, a last revision is needed, and a big chat with the CEO. New semseter, 2 new classes wich are boring as hell, I can't stand them.

**Thoughts** : Good start, let's keep it good.

## Day 224, Aug 11th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 274, to find the h-index, actually, it was re-solved, but this time, I understood it quite better, it's definetly not binary search intuitive right away, also did 1486, to perform an XOR in an array and 1469 to find the amount of lonely nodes (only child) in a binary tree, really easy to get the answer. Got doubly confirmed on Utopyan, I'll have my first payment on Friday, I'll start tomorrow actually in the backend. Got semi-confirmed to NFL Survivor, we had to negotiate prices and future updates prices, but, we managed to convice them, good signs for our entrepreneurial project on shark tank (maybe?).

**Thoughts** : Can't keep the pace on my super schedule but I'll do my best.

## Day 225, Aug 12th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 119, to return a single row from a Pascal triangle, also did 118, wich is to generate a full Pascal triangle, solved it first actually, to understand better the 119 that feels more like a follow up. Not the brightest day, waste time doing homework from classes, practically irrelevant to this challenge.

**Thoughts** : Better pace I guess, but not happy, must push harder, monday was nuts, let's aim to be like Aug 10 everyday.

## Day 226, Aug 13th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 1286, a system design, to create a iterator for combinations, basically, "generate" all permutations of a string and return the next with a function, really hard for me. Two classes, a loooooot of time wasted, it was the 4th or 5th time I see scrum in a class... c'mon, I'll be graduating in months, I must know that by now, it would be unnacceptable to not know it. More design and refinement on the database of the survivor project.

**Thoughts** : Wasted a freaking lot of time doing homework, this suuuuucks.

## Day 227, Aug 14th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 409, to find the longest palindrome available, solved with a hashamp, considering divisible by 2 and a single unique letter to create the longest palindrome. Worked as a PM for both projects, got a meeting with the client, solved some issues and stated what I needed to start. Watched Udemy for AWS, but I think is not as useful as I thought, I know how to create things but not how to use them...

**Thoughts** : Payment and delivery agreement, way more formal now.

## Day 228, Aug 15th 2020

**Today's Progress**: Solved LeetCode daily challenge, problem 484, the premium question, to return an increasing/decreasing interval from 1 to n with a string key, like key = DI, result = [2,1,3], really interesting, solved it using a stack, and problem 435, to find overlapping intervals, sorted and using a greedy aproached did the trick. More AWS on Udemy, kinda got what I wanted but at a super low level of what I actually need. Did the Utopyan backlog, will do on Monday a Trello Kanban for my professor and my client.

**Thoughts** : Got the payment, let's start the survivor.
